To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3×3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.","total_rating":47.5504156720718,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/3-d-tic-tac-toe","videos":[{"id":15463,"game":11854,"name":"VR","video_id":"cQiKut1p_vc","checksum":"bbf02c6f-d51c-142a-07ff-93579f52b3b5"}]}
