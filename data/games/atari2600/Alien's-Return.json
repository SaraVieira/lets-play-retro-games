Go into the several rooms and press the button. Hopefully, a piece of the ship will show on a corner of the screen. Pick it up and repeat the procedure until you can back home. Beware of the guardians, though, as they would follow you to trap you.","summary":"UFI und sein gefährlicher Einsatz, known as E.T. Go Home in the United States, is a 1983 video game created for the Atari 2600 that is loosely based on the 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It was created in Europe. Copies of the game are very rare, and most copies still have the typo of the title, which reads, E.T. Go Come. The cover shows E.T. standing near a parade of anthropomorphic jelly sandwiches, balloons, trees, and chicken nuggets. None of these creatures ever appear in the game. It is the European version of a game called Alien's Return.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ufi-und-sein-gefahrlicher-einsatz"}
