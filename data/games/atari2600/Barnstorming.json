Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time. There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barnstorming","videos":[{"id":7097,"game":18032,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"1omwJegOAH8","checksum":"8c4754e9-8041-5768-d935-af219ca90b63"}]}
