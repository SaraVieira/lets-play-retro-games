The game lasts for two minutes, and the player who can earn the most points in that time wins. You earn one point for a long jab, two points for a close power punch, and if you can manage knockout it's worth one hundred points. Two difficulty levels are included which can be set individually for each player.","total_rating":69.9773584668782,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/boxing--1","videos":[{"id":15574,"game":55103,"name":"VR","video_id":"GeSN8DV_ysU","checksum":"83d210d0-9f51-2795-6b39-15cc5e1dc9cd"}]}
