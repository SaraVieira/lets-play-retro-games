The player and an opponent fly a blimp or biplane over a canyon full of numbered, circular rocks, arranged in layers. The player does not control the flight of vehicles, but only presses a button to drop bombs which destroy rocks and give points. Each rock is labeled with the points given for destroying it. As the number of rocks is reduced, it becomes harder to hit them without missing. The third time a player drops a bomb without hitting a rock, the game is over.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/canyon-bomber--1","videos":[{"id":55434,"game":172789,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"8_i1UJRL960","checksum":"9e3941ba-8bf0-8b9c-9056-00fae960d687"}]}
