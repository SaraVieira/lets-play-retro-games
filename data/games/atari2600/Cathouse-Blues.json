Grab some cash from the teller, and visit each woman. A visit will cost $20, at which time you'll find yourself in her bed. Score with her as many times as you can before you're forced to leave for the next. The cops are in pursuit as well as a mugger who wants your money. Visiting a wrong house will cause you to be temporarily immobilized (a sitting duck for the cops) as you figure out what to do next. The roles of the men and women are switched in Gigolo.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cathouse-blues"}
