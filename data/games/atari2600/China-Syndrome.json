To do this you are in control of a robot arm with which you can grab the free-flying particles preferably before they have time to split and therefore raising the radiation level. The screen is separated into three sections from top to bottom (red, blue and yellow). Every section has an indicator at the bottom of the screen telling you where the radiation level is getting to high and therefore enabling you to decide on which section to concentrate your efforts for the moment. In later levels your have to be careful not to damage the circulation fans or you lose one robot arm. The game is over either after you have lost all your robot arms or you have cleared the ninth and final stage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/china-syndrome","videos":[{"id":24409,"game":18554,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"fo21Q7fslMw","checksum":"14bea989-228a-0b5b-26a4-a873f0f4af68"}]}
