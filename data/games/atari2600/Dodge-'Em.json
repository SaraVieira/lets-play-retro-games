The player controls one car and has to drive counter-clockwise, avoiding computer-controlled cars whose sole aim is to produce a head-on collision. The player's car can travel at two speeds, a 'normal' speed which is the same speed as computer-controlled cars, or if the player presses the controller button, his or her car travels at a 'fast' speed double its normal speed. The computer-controlled cars have only one speed. Players change lanes by pushing the controller in the appropriate direction when their car is near one of the gaps in the roadway.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dodge-em","videos":[{"id":15467,"game":17020,"name":"VR","video_id":"d1edvROHa8k","checksum":"f8a0c881-0809-0135-2002-c4774160cc02"}]}
