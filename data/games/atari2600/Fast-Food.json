The game's manual gives the name of the lips as Mighty Mouth.[2] Various fast food menu items fly across the screen and the teeth earns points by catching them. The player must avoid eating the purple pickles. After eating 6 purple pickles, the screen is replaced by large text reading \"BURP\", followed by \"CLOSED\". As the player acquires more points, the speed of the game increases. The transitions between speeds are indicated by the text \"YOU'RE GETTING FATTER!\"","summary":"The objective of the game is to eat as much fast food as you can by devouring the junk food that is approaching your huge mouth from the left of the screen. While doing that you should be careful to avoid the purple pickles - after having eaten six of those it is game over.\n\nFast Food was written by Don Ruffcorn.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fast-food--1"}
