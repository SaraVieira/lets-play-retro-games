To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/human-cannonball"}
