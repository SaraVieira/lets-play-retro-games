It is themed around the Indianapolis 500, and is based on Atari's earlier 8-player arcade game, Indy 800.\n\nIndy 500 was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. Sears Tele-Games later re-released it as Race; no changes were made to the gameplay. Included with each game was a set of two driving controllers, which were identical in appearance to the 2600 paddle controller but could rotate indefinitely in either direction, among other differences.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/indy-500--1","videos":[{"id":15441,"game":54790,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yJlOERmMJGw","checksum":"0b0b0bb0-9807-9ec7-5617-f4d71e2f9f13"}]}
