Your mission is to infiltrate a top secret fortress. You must capture enemy documents and get out alive.

Your weapon: a high-power laser gun as powerful as that of the enemy. Your advantage: you're sharp enough to duck when they shoot. It's a hectic chase. Hop an elevator. Survive enemy fire. Fire back. Duck. Infiltrate...if you dare!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/infiltrate"}
