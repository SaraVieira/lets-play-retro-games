Four ghosts roam the maze and attempt to capture him. The player can eat an energizer to turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable for a short time and allowing the player to eat them, sending their eyes back to their home base. When all the dots are cleared, a new maze is presented and gameplay resumes.","total_rating":71.2364970397153,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jr-pac-man"}
