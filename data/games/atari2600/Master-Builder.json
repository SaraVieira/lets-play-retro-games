Your task then is to build that construction from memory using bricks which the player can find on the left and right sides of the screen. You have to watch out for a dog which will run into you if you don't dodge it, as well for a kid who will steal your ladder. As your construction gets higher you will also have to watch out for bolts of lightening from a thunderstorm. If your replica is correct and you are at the top of the building a helicopter will carry you off to the next construction site.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/master-builder"}
