The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships. \n \nThe player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/missile-control"}
