This version is more directly comparable to Midway's Gun Fight,[2] allowing two players to engage in a shoot-out using 2600's joysticks. There are also multiple types of play that differ slightly from the arcade game, including target practice and versions with obstacles that must be shot around or shot through.","total_rating":57.0775946289855,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/outlaw","videos":[{"id":15447,"game":15562,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"WZwaw2EWOg8","checksum":"3eed8e11-f722-71b3-f35e-951a8beb63e8"}]}
