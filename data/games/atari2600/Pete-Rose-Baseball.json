(Spitballs?) \n* Head to head action with your friends or against the computer. \n* Complete TV-like coverage, with six camera angles you're always right there \n where the action is. \n* Play to a packed stadium complete with cheering crowd and organist. (Bring \n your own peanuts and hotdogs.) \n* The most exciting baseball ever on the 2600 with depth and feel you've \n seen on Big League Home Computers.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pete-rose-baseball"}
