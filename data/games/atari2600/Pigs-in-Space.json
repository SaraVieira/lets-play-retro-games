Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points. \n \nCaptain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted. \n \nFirst Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. \n \nThe final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pigs-in-space"}
