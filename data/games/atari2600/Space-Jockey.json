From the right side of the screen, a barrage of tanks, jet planes, prop planes and helicopters will fire upon and try to crash into your ship. Your job is to shoot or dodge them. In addition to the aforementioned enemies, houses, balloons and trees litter the screen. These three types of obstacles don't fire, but they are deadly to the touch and can be destroyed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-jockey"}
