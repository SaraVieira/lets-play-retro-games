The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sprint-master","videos":[{"id":50335,"game":18423,"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"q31HTepKuyE","checksum":"49677a5e-84bc-9976-ed1d-b769ae87d981"}]}
