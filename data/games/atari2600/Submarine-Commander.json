Use your skills, radar, and luck to take down the enemy ships. With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises. You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can. The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub. Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.\n\nThis game was never released under any name by Atari. It was a Sears exclusive.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/submarine-commander--1","videos":[{"id":50357,"game":54796,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"KwXiAp5mZ54","checksum":"70898436-0d56-aa81-fbc8-ff45297ffa99"}]}
