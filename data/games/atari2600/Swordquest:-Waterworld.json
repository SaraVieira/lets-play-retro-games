Tara travels to a ship made of ice, somehow forgets her name, and meets Cap'n Frost, who desires to find the \"Crown of Life\" and rule Waterworld. Meanwhile, Torr travels to an undersea kingdom, forgets his name as well and meets the city's ex-queen Aquana, who desires to find the \"Crown of Life\" in order to regain her throne.\n\nAfter a brief war between the ex-queen and captain, Herminus sets the twins to duel each other. They then pray to their deities for guidance, which summons Mentorr who allows them to regain their memories. The twins throw down their swords, causing the crown to be revealed and split in half.
