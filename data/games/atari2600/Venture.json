You start out on an overview map of a dungeon which shows several rooms containing treasure. Since you cannot kill any enemies while rummaging through the dungeon corridors you have to dodge them on your way to the treasure rooms since they will kill you instantly. After entering one of the rooms you are able to fight the various monsters lurking in the rooms while you collect the treasure. Be careful not to linger to long in the treasure rooms because an \"Evil Otto\" like monster will appear which is invincible and will hunt you down until you leave the room again. After having collected every treasure in every room of a dungeon you move on to the next dungeon.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/venture"}
