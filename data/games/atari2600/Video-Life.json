It is a version of the zero-player cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. Video Life was only available through a special mail order offer to owners of CommaVid's Magicard, which itself is considered to be one of the rarest Atari 2600 cartridges ever released. According to original CommaVid co-owner Irwin Gaines, only 20 cartridges or less of Video Life were ever made. Editors of AtariAge estimate approximately 500 cartridges were produced. A report in the Chicago Reader by Jeffrey Felshman estimates that cartridges would sell for as much $3000 at the time.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/video-life","videos":[{"id":27023,"game":40647,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"gqSwlcb-NgU","checksum":"e4d1ecce-7e53-19a4-3055-319ae27cdeed"}]}
