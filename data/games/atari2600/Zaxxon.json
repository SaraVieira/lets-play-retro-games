The game gives the player the experience of flying a fighter craft through a fortress while shooting at enemy entities (missiles, enemy gunfire, etc.) The object of the game is to hit as many targets as possible without being shot down or running out of fuel, which can be replenished paradoxically, by blowing up fuel drums.","total_rating":79.89693932067306,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zaxxon","videos":[{"id":23954,"game":2753,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"cB-Tt6O9Onc","checksum":"39ce19c5-25b4-cf43-55f0-ce54d7029df9"}]}
