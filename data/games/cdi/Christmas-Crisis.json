It's quite common to find other CD-i reference lists quote Christmas Crisis and Christmas Country as one of the same game however this is not the case and two entirely unique games were released by the same developer. Christmas Crisis was the first release in 1995 under the developers name DIMA which chaged to Creative Media when Christmas Country was released in 1996.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/christmas-crisis"}
