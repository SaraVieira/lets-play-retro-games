Soon, Link's hopes are fulfilled, as a wizard named Gwonam arrives on a magic carpet, telling them that Ganon (the series' antagonist) and his minions have taken over the island of Koridai. Although King Harkinian immediately offers aid, Gwonam explains that according to a prophecy, \"only Link can defeat Ganon\". Link is transported to Koridai and Gwonam shows him the fabled island's giant stone statues, known as the Faces of Evil, which Link must conquer. During Link's time in Koridai, Princess Zelda is kidnapped by Ganon and imprisoned in his lair.\n\nOver the course of the game, Link proceeds through Koridai, defeating Ganon's minions and retrieving an artifact known as The Book of Koridai, which is revealed to be enough to defeat Ganon. Link confronts Ganon, who attempts to recruit him with the promise of great power. Link defeats Ganon and imprisons him in the Book of Koridai before awakening the sleeping Zelda. Gwonam appears and congratulates Link on imprisoning Ganon. He shows the two a rapidly recovering Koridai and declares Link the island's hero. However, Zelda refuses to kiss him as a reward.","summary":"Ganon and his minions have seized the peaceful island of Koridai and imprisoned Zelda.
