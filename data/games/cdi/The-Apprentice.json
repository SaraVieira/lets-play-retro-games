As Marvin, a wizard's apprentice, your master Mr. Wandburner gives you a series of tasks to complete, spread out on six levels with three stages each, taking place on land, in the sea and in the air. In order to make your life in the aquatic levels easier, the wizard will turn you into a frog. In order to fly, you're equipped with a special flying helmet. Each level has a new weapon for you to use, ranging from the traditional magic wand to a rubber ball, a water pistol or even a laser gun. As in any normal platform game, each level has an end-boss, and between levels are bonus rounds.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-apprentice--1","videos":[{"id":27618,"game":81551,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"RTkxj_o43ts","checksum":"d4eed7d0-fe67-98fb-5bae-caee20014d56"}]}
