It departed from the original game by focusing on the comic-book version of Batman instead of the movie-inspired conception. The story itself was self-contained, and did not depict a pre-existing storyline. The game is a side-scrolling platformer with beat 'em up features.","total_rating":63.4814741788974,"total_rating_count":23,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-return-of-the-joker","videos":[{"id":4226,"game":4489,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"3_vIbUvDlE4","checksum":"63e61a2f-6528-c12c-1e94-5b5a7c9b8fe5"}]}
