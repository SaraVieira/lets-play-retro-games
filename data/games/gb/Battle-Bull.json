Most of the other stones are a permanent part of the underground cavern; while others can be used to eliminate the opponents. Money is earned after each level for the purpose of upgrading the player's vehicle. Players can improve their engines, purchase extra lives, shovels that can dig better, and weapons to improve the odds on the playing field. A kill ratio is required to be met in order to reach the next stage. Otherwise, the player remains in the current level. \n \nAfter finishing all 48 levels, the game proclaims that the \"battle is over\" and that the player becomes \"the new champion.\" The final scene in the game is where the player looks over the sunset with his girlfriend along with the closing credits.","total_rating":63,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-bull"}
