The game was later released for the Game Boy and was included in the Japanese version of Star Fox: Assault. It is a port of the arcade game Tank Battalion with additional features (including two player simultaneous play and a level edit feature). There was also a rendition for Nintendo's Vs. System arcade cabinets.\n\nThe player, controlling a tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives.","total_rating":83.7267857146602,"total_rating_count":49,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-city","videos":[{"id":39884,"game":4596,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Xww2jXpQSwQ","checksum":"3467589c-9275-b7ff-2be1-d101a590a8b0"},{"id":39885,"game":4596,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Q2SCPMurOO4","checksum":"0b51fcf4-8837-a427-674c-7b397dec8fb6"}]}
