Months have passed... and the Queen's parting threat of revenge has become a distant memory to Professor T. Bird and the Battletoads - Zitz, Rash and Pimple.\n\nHowever, when a mysterious energy beam from outer space renders Earth's military might powerless, and a city-sized spaceship called the Colossus smashes out of the moon, the Professor knows it has to be the Dark Queen trying her latest galaxy-dominating plan.\n\nHe's right, of course, but what he doesn't realize is that the shady lady's taking no chances this time, and she's cunningly teamed up with the equally shady Shadow Boss! This means that the Battletoads will not only have to fight the Queen and her sidekicks, General Slaughter, Big Blag and Robo Manus - but Abobo and Roper, the Shadow Boss's minions, as well!\n\nSo, that's how it stands 'toads: the Dark Queen's got herself some serious back-up and now she's comin' to take over your Earth - what're ya gonna do about it? First of all you're gonna get the sides EVEN! Those terrific twins, Billy and Jimmy Lee, otherwise known as the Double Dragon, are just rarin' to get in on the action, 'specially since the Shadow Boss is their archest of enemies!","summary":"Battletoads & Double Dragon - The Ultimate Team is the fourth game in the Battletoads series.
