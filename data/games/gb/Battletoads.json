Unfortunately, the dancer isn't what she appears to be - and soon reveals herself as the evil Dark Queen!\n\nThe 'toads fight valiantly against overwhelming odds, but are eventually overpowered. Yet, all is not lost! Although Rash and Pimple are taken prisoner, Zitz makes it to the Toadster and burns space back to the Vulture and Professor T. Bird, the Battletoads' mentor. Rash and Pimple are taken away in the Gargantua to the planet Armagedda, but luckily Zitz and the Professor are hot on their trail...\n\nSo there's the situation, Zitz: the Dark Queen's 'toadnapped your best buddies - what're ya gonna do about it? You're gonna get real MAD, that's what you're gonna do - and then you're gonna get EVEN!\n\nProfessor Bird's gonna set you down on Armagedda, but from then on it's up to you. You've got a long way to go, Zitz - into caverns, across swamps and even through the belly of the dreaded Wurm. And ultimately, of course, you're gonna have to defeat the terrible, the towering, the truly 'toadsplatting Robo-Manus mutant!\n\nHave you got what it takes to be a bona-fide Battletoad?
