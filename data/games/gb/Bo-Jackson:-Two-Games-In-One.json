In baseball, you can participate in all the major parts of the ballgame, such as pitching, hitting, and fielding. The field is displayed in 3D using an engine called \"3-D Sensation.\" In football, the field is displayed as an overhead view in 2D with tiny players running around -- a sharp contrast to the graphic style of the baseball portion of the game. The football game allows you to design your own plays and watch them with instant replay.","total_rating":57,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bo-jackson-two-games-in-one"}
