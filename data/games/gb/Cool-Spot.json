In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of \"spots\" that would change (usually increase) as the game progressed. \"Spots\" were placed across the level in large quantities, and were the game's substitute for items such as the coins in Super Mario Bros","summary":"Cool Spot is a mascot for 7 Up, introduced in 1987. During this time, the red spot in the 7 Up logo was anthropomorphized: given arms, legs, a mouth, and sunglasses. British video games developer Virgin Interactive's American studio produced a platform game starring the 7 Up Spot, entitled Cool Spot.","total_rating":63.6436561338833,"total_rating_count":48,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cool-spot","videos":[{"id":1438,"game":2621,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"0iMM2vqrE08","checksum":"cf0d65ef-fec0-8e55-2bd1-3a22197d4bf7"},{"id":1439,"game":2621,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"nsbwXl-EuHw","checksum":"80586316-5d0e-2976-730d-7882273f756c"}]}
