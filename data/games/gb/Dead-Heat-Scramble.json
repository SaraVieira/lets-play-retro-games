All races are strictly against the clock while the driver navigates through blockades on the road and other drivers that want to defeat the player. All of the ten courses must be unlocked in a linear fashion; all the races take place in a tube. Few power-ups exist in them game; including a chance to increase the player's nitro boost. \n \nThere are ten stages in the entire game. No penalties are given for bumping into the other drivers; unlike real life. Each course is in the shape of a half-pipe.","total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-heat-scramble"}
