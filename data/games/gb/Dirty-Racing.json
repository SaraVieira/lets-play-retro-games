You then move around a board game-like map to choose your next race. \n \nDespite the game being Japanese exclusive, the entire game's text is in English. The game also shares another similarity with Super Off Road, that being scantily clad women who are shown when a race is finished.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dirty-racing"}
