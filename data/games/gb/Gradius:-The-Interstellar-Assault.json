Once again the player takes control of the Vic Viper and flies through five different stages destroying Bacterion's army.\n\nThe game retains the traditional power-up bar from the original Gradius. The player can speed-up multiple times, use missiles, shoot double firepower or lasers, use several options at a time and use the classic shield (although it is referred to as a forcefield). However, before each game is started or continued, the player is given a \"Weapon Select\" screen. Here the player can choose between one of three settings for the missiles, double firepower, and lasers.","total_rating":71.5869131053099,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault","videos":[{"id":20026,"game":48996,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"_TCvAOYEXsw","checksum":"c0205dee-d214-f895-fec3-3c706c1c4feb"}]}
