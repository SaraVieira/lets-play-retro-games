The object is to race laps around a muddy race track while trying to get first place. There are twenty tracks to race in; each with a timer that forces the player to race fast. There is an option to either do a single race or a multi-race tournament against a computer opponent or through a human playing while using the Game Boy link cable and another copy of the video game. Items in the background like electric lines and rocks help provide a road-like feeling to the races. \n \nIn a single-player race, the player will race to the finish line against a field of approximately nineteen other drivers.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jeep-jamboree-off-road-adventure","videos":[{"id":46625,"game":48979,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Lt-tlLh6B1o","checksum":"1f5cf2c2-b29e-1bc2-5020-96dce4dacbc4"}]}
