It follows Hikaru Agata on his quest to compete in Robottle tournaments and defeat the evil Roborobo Gang.\n\nLike the other creature-collecting games of the time, Medarot 1 was released in two versions: Kabuto (Rhinoceros beetle), where the player's starting Medarot is Metal Beetle, and Kuwagata (Stag beetle), where the player starts with Head Scissors. Along with the starting Medarots, there are some Medarots and Medals that can only be obtained in a specific version. No English versions of the game were released.\n\nMedarot 1 is a monochrome Game Boy game with only basic palette support when played on a Game Boy Color. However, it has a border and more advanced colors when played on a Super Game Boy.\n\nA \"director's cut\" edition of the game titled Medarot Perfect Edition was released for Bandai's Japan-only Wonderswan system in 1999. It had two versions and was also monochrome-only. Later that year, the direct sequel Medarot 2 was released for Game Boy.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/medarot-kabuto-version"}
