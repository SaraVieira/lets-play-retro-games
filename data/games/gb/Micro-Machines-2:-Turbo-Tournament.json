There are different playing modes including \"head-to-head\", in which each player earns points by driving a full screen ahead of the opponent. TV presenter Violet Berlin features as a playable driver. The MS-DOS version featured a track editor.\nA selling point for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version was the J-Cart, a cartridge including two control ports, thus eliminating the need for a 4-player adaptor. It also included a 'pad-sharing' feature which allowed 2 players to share a single joypad; thus it enabled 8 players to compete simultaneously, on certain tracks.","total_rating":84.4374074145886,"total_rating_count":23,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament","videos":[{"id":3449,"game":8775,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"omgZpeALT3U","checksum":"7a09f5a4-4306-5bc8-6ff6-e755d4b5e418"}]}
