The player can choose to play as any of the six rangers, who will start off each stage as a Ninja Ranger. The Red, Blue, and White Rangers are the stronger characters, while Black, Pink, and Yellow are more agile. By defeating enemies throughout each stage, mainly Putty Patrols, and accumulating enough Thunderbolt items to fill up the power gauge, the player can transform their character into a Power Ranger. Filling up the power gauge again while in Power Ranger mode will allow the player to perform a super attack. The game consists of six stages. The first five stages can be played in any order, while the sixth one can only be played after completing the other five.","total_rating":64,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie--2"}
