Players control the player character and guitarist Max as he attempts to defeat evil villain Krond, who threatens to ban all music from the world. The game is split into 29 levels in which the player must complete a number of challenges in order to progress, such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The levels also contain several helpful items, such as bombs, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden rooms, a bag, to pick up or drop items in, and a force shield, which protects the player from enemies, among others. Upon completing a level, the player is rewarded with a certain amount of credits, which grant players access to new areas of the game's overworld, called the Mega Hero Academy.","summary":"Monster Max is an isometric adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Titus Software for the Game Boy handheld game console. It was released in December 1994 in Europe and January 1995 in the United States. Monster Max was designed by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond and is very similar in both graphics and gameplay to Ritman and Drummond's 1987 title Head over Heels. The game sold poorly but received very positive reviews from critics.","total_rating":76,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-max","videos":[{"id":7709,"game":18629,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"eLwbripbgm0","checksum":"63033070-57df-93cc-a49d-819753be837d"}]}
