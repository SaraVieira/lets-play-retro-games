The series is available on numerous platforms.\n\nThe game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius--3","videos":[{"id":55569,"game":174933,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"d4SVHPP7fEU","checksum":"2f97fdbe-7108-9090-72d1-b5eebf0613f0"}]}
