{"id":49100,"first_release_date":886291200,"genres":[{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"name":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","slug":"the-adventures-of-pinocchio","summary":"Adventures of Pinocchio is a beta version of Ottifanten, an action puzzle game developed by Bit Managers and released in 1998 for the GameBoy, based on some German comics. While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, \"Adventures of…\" is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten.\nA playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it's often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won't work. This is no final release and there is none because it's an unreleased game.\n\nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name \"Infrey Quest\", so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters.\n\nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio. It even looks like the basic stage design is the same.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-pinocchio"}
