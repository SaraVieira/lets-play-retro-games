This game is the precursor to an identically-titled arcade release.\n\nPuyo Puyo is the first entry of Compile's Puyo Puyo series. It was released on the MSX and Famicom Disk System on October 25, 1991; the FDS version was published by Tokuma Shoten as part of their \"Famimaga Disk\" line of games. The FDS version would later be released on a Famicom cart in 1993. Puyo Puyo would be succeeded by a much more popular arcade game of the same name.\n\nPuyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.","total_rating":65.1651191584089,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo"}
