The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.","total_rating":67.69750984887736,"total_rating_count":24,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-shodown-iii","videos":[{"id":37037,"game":19987,"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"VUxPwSlWWrc","checksum":"2c2a39bb-111b-48a4-56dc-3e98e83dd738"}]}
