While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks","total_rating":48.98022,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-star-sweep"}
