You were prepared for almost anything - anything but the rampant mutants that infest this raging realm of never-ending combat. Half organic, half technological, the freakish life forms of Axtar have only one instinct: to attack.\n\nHordes of alien beasties come at you from all sides and your ship is transported from world to world through fire levels. You shudder at the sight of grotesque globule-emitting eyeballs, terrifying buzzsaw-like energy disks, implacable, poison jetting phenocrysts, and huge end-level bosses.\n\nAs the battle rages on, you'll need nerves of steel and lightning quick reflexes to survive!","summary":"A space shmup from Accolade with parallax scrolling. The player controls an upgradable spaceship through five stages.","total_rating":57,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/starhawk--2"}
