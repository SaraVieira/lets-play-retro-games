The chase leads them through the sewers and the streets of New York City, the river, and then the Technodrome.","summary":"In cahoots with exiled alien zap master Krang, the evil Shredder has once again kidnapped the dashing damsel of the news desk, April O'Neil. To rescue this ravishing reporter, you must return to the sewers and dredge forth those reptiles with a penchant for pizza and all the nifty knifework of a chop suey chef. You'll control every move of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael as they arm themselves with head-rattling Nunchakus, back-stabbing Sai Swords, and liver-lashing Katana Blades. Of course, this once in a light year adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5 never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you'll perfect the ancient art of icing, dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you'll get the chance to wipe the smirks off the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and that nasty villain Filet O'Filth. So get back into your shell and start snapping away, before April goes from delivering the news to singing the blues in some new cement shoes.","total_rating":55.5173815754469,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-fall-of-the-foot-clan","videos":[{"id":48075,"game":48928,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"r1sPSAEm2Yo","checksum":"9deeb68e-3988-3209-80f5-401230bb39c8"}]}
