Wednesday has devised a simply torturous game which will drive her darling wretched brother, Pugsley, to happiness. How absolutely delicious! She has hidden six wonderfully strange items somewhere about the Addams Family Mansion. Now, you must guide poor Pugsley on his quest to uncover them. Traps, traps, traps you say! Well, yes. What else would add so much lovely horror to this unnaturally delightful fun? Little Wednesday has made sure this adventure will be a doom-filled doozie. There are hidden switches all about, which produce the loveliest blood-curdling effects when Pugsley runs into them. And let’s not forget all the money that Pugsley will be able to gather on his way. There’s even magic money which will have an extra lively effect you won’t want to miss. So get ready to get spooky, and get set to get kooky… it’s Pugsley’s Scavenger Hunt! En garde!","summary":"The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a video game featuring The Addams Family characters from the 1992 animated series. \n \nThe game is a side scrolling platformer adventure game that plays in a very similar way to the previous Addams Family title. The game plays in a non-linear way in so much that the player can choose which level to attempt by entering whichever door they choose in the Addams house.","total_rating":59.8624153541075,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt","videos":[{"id":36576,"game":5344,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"tVg8m_BYqcw","checksum":"5ad9b832-e1b5-31ec-1349-a4114a8cddc8"}]}
