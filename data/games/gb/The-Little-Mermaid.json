She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.\n\nThe treasure she finds in the sand is usually just bonus points, but the treasure you find in chests will increase your bubble's power and range.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-ariel-the-little-mermaid"}
