The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase. The wheel can be \"spun\" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wheel-of-fortune--4"}
