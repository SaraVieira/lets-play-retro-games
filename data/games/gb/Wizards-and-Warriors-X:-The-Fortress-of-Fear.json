As Kuros you'll enter the dreaded Fortress of Fear in your pursuit of the Evil Wizard, Malkil. Hundreds of enemy encounters await you. Deadly bats and other flying beasts attack from above. Scorching fireballs and arrows speed toward you. And skin crawling spiders and undead skeletons appear from the darkness. Defeat them all! Only those with the blackest of hearts dwell among the 18 levels of challenging game play. But the rewards are great, riches beyond belief, keys to long lost treasure and magic spells and potions. And what better reward could you seek than a final encounter with the Evil Wizard Malkil himself? Beware, Kuros. Others have journeyed into the Fortress of Fear, but none have returned alive.","total_rating":63,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wizards-and-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear"}
