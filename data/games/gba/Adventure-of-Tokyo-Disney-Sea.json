The Aqua Sphere (symbol of the park) is also depicted. Disney's characters include Aladdin and Ariel, among many others.\n\nThe main objective is to collect cards (containing rock-paper-scissors). Some will be given while others can only be obtained if the player defeats his opponent. The versus battles occur through card usage. Some of these cards are the key to defeat the toughest opponents.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-of-tokyo-disney-sea"}
