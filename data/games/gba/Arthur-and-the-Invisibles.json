Arthur and the Minimoys for DS gleefully portrays the magical world of Arthur through a series of original and entertaining micro games and with an absorbing 'virtual pet simulator' where players are responsible for caring for and breeding 'Mul mull', small, fluffy, flying creatures found in abundance in the world of Arthur.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arthur-and-the-invisibles--1"}
