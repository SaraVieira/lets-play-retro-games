Players start as a Matoran and unlock more Matoran characters as they progress. Turaga, with their unique powers, can be \"picked up\" throughout the game to help the player through an elemental hazard like a lava pool or to activate a switch to a secret door. Once found, that \"picked-up\" Turaga follows you onwards in your adventure.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bionicle-matoran-adventures"}
