The compilation includes CHESS, CHECKERS, and BACKGAMMON. Each game has several different options for players. In CHESS, for example, gamers can watch fantasy and sci-fi pieces battle it out each time a piece is taken. CHECKERS, too, has several different themed boards, including space and Atlantis, that can change the look and feel of the game. All three games have different difficulty settings for players. Variants on the traditional rules are also available for each game. In addition to challenging the AI to a match or playing through a tournament, players can also use the GBA link to challenge friends to any of the three games using any of the rule variations and settings. Gamers who love these three classic games are sure to enjoy their GBA incarnations, and the ability to challenge others to a match adds to the fun and replayability.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/board-game-classics"}
