Buffy hunts loathsome legions through 16 twilit levels before confronting the ultimate evil in the form of the Darkhul King. This side-scroller is crammed with interactive environments -- a fancy phrase meaning you get to break lots of stuff, like doors, crates, spider webs, vases, benches and even stone walls.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-wrath-of-the-darkhul-king"}
