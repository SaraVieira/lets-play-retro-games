As the title character, you must blow up bricks and enemies on the battlefield in an effort to find the door to the next level. In each stage, you'll find power-ups that extend your blast radius. However, if you're caught in your own bomb blast, you must start the level over.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/classic-nes-series-bomberman"}
