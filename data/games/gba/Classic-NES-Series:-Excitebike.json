As in the original, your biker must keep his balance while flying through the air, avoid getting clipped by other racers, and prevent his bike from overheating. In Design mode, you can make your own course--with all the ramps, mounds, bridges, and other obstacles in the game--and then save the design for your friends to race on.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/classic-nes-series-excitebike"}
