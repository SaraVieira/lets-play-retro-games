Their magic was used to transform all the Mushroom People into inanimate objects such as rocks, bricks, and even horsehair plants, thus spelling the kingdom's downfall. Only Princess Toadstool can undo the spell and restore her people back to life, but she is being held captive by King Koopa himself. Mario hears of the princess's plight, and sets out on a quest through 32 stages to topple the Turtle Tribe and save the once-peaceful kingdom","summary":"Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros. takes you back to the very first battle between Mario and Bowser. Now on the Game Boy Advance, you can relive all the mushroom-eating, Koopa-stomping action from the original game. Always strive for the high score while jumping on top of flag poles, pipes, and bricks. This time, two players can alternate play with a single Game Pak or with GBAs linked by a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/classic-nes-series-super-mario-bros","videos":[{"id":57358,"game":18065,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"MrtGe_UrZLA","checksum":"6e9ef7be-fe83-24b5-e13a-61fbb289e154"}]}
