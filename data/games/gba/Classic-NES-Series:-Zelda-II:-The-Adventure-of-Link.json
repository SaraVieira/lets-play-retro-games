The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/classic-nes-series-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link"}
