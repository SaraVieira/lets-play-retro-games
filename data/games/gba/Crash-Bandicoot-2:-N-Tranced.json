After the events of Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, Tropy, with the help of N. Trance, kidnaps Coco and Crunch, planning to brainwash them to the evil side. Now, Crash must travel to N. Trance's twisted realm, battle and rescue Coco and Crunch, and ultimately defeat N. Trance and N. Tropy. To achieve these goals, you must use all of Crash's spin, slide, and jumping abilities across 24 different levels.
