The game mimics the film's famous martial arts, based on the Wudan fighting style, with a set of basic attacks, attack combos and special moves, combined with defensive actions such as basic blocking, combo blocking and evasion. While fighting, the characters learn new moves, collect items and earn rewards. Skills are improved according to your fighting style. Using specific attacks (e.g. unarmed) boosts the related skills, which can be leveled up.","total_rating":53.75,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon"}
