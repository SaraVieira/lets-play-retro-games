Though the game was marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional \"Pow!\" and \"Bif!\" when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the 23 different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daredevil","videos":[{"id":7421,"game":18254,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vd9OswOkH8o","checksum":"fc744d86-dbad-bd12-c3a9-05e250276b1e"}]}
