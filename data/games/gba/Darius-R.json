Invasion!\n\nThe vicious Belsar have attacked the peaceful Darius system, which now faces absolute devastation at their abominable hands! Darius' defense fighters proved no match for the overwhelming firepower of the alien forces, which wiped out their entire fleet in one fell swoop!\n\nWith nothing left to protect them, the people could only sit and wait for the icy embrace of death as the satellite bombardments continued unopposed. The scent of despair hung thickly in the air, all hope of survival having been quashed.\n\nBut then, from out of the darkness of the mourning clouds came a single bright light in the sky.\n\n\"Silverhawk.........\"\n\nLike a phoenix brought forth from the embers of a burning world, the bird shaped visage became a beacon of the planet's last fight for survival! Perhaps the end is not as nigh as it first appeared.","summary":"Darius R is a shoot em up video game released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance only in Japan. This game is a remixed version of Darius, which reuses assets from the original game.\n\nDue to the small resolution of the GBA, and since the game never scales the large Arcade sprites, the camera follows the the player up and down to compensate. While the first stage is more or less based on the first stage from the original game, the remaining stages are all exclusive to this title, featuring unique background graphics and remixed tracks from previous titles in the series. Stages can be replayed once they are beaten in the regular Arcade Mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/darius-r","videos":[{"id":47926,"game":49277,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"mL1ckgNx99k","checksum":"a7a6a92f-d482-363c-ac5a-b3e33e39f842"}]}
