One day, DK and Diddy suddenly disappear, and a letter from Diddy says they were out exploring the island again.\n\nHowever, several days pass without their return, and Dixie knows something is up. She takes matters into her own hands, and made her way to the southern shores of Donkey Kong Island, to the Northern Kremisphere, a Canadian and northern European-inspired landmass. There she meets Wrinkly Kong, and Wrinkly confirmed that the Kongs had passed by. Dixie then makes her way to Funky's Rentals.
