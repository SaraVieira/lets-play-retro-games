Though Dr. Mario has already been released on the GBA as a Classic NES Series title, the version included in the dual-pack is enhanced specifically for the Game Boy Advance hardware instead of a straight emulation of the original NES title. Puzzle League was originally brought to life as Tetris Attack, but then rebranded on the Game Boy Color as Pokemon Puzzle Challenge a few years back. The GBA version is also enhanced for the GBA's much more capable graphics hardware and was previously an unlockable game via the GameCube - Game Boy Advance Link Cable in Nintendo Puzzle Collection for the GameCube.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dr-mario-and-puzzle-league"}
