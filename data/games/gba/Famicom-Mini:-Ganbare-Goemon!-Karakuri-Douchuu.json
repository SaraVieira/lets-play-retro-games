It is a remake of Konami's Famicom game Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Douchuu, and little to no alterations were made on the game to stay faithful to the original title. The game was not released in America or Europe, and thus was exclusive to Japan. It was part of the Famicom Mini Series that re-released a variety of classic Famicom games for the Game Boy Advance.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-mini-ganbare-goemon-karakuri-douchuu"}
