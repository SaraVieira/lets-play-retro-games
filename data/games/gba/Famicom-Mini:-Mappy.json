It is a remake of Namco's Famicom video game Mappy. This game was not released in America or Europe as part of the Classic NES Series, but was rather exclusive to Japan. Few to no alterations were made to the game, as it was intended to be a direct port of Mappy.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-mini-mappy"}
