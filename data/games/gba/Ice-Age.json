Based on events depicted in the motion picture, Ice Age tasks players with guiding both Manny the Mammoth and Sid the Sloth through ten levels of platform-oriented action. Starting out, players control Manny who, along with the human baby Roshan, must navigate a myriad of environments while keeping saber-tooth tigers, hedgehogs, and bees at bay. To do so, Manny is capable of hurling large nuts as makeshift projectiles at any on-screen enemies. Wild animals aren't the only obstacle players will encounter, as they'll need to move a sleeping rhinoceros to advance and inhale skunk fumes to float over dangerous chasms.","total_rating":33,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ice-age"}
