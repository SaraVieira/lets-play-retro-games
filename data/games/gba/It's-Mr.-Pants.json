The idea is simple: form rectangles of larger than 3x2 to make them disappear from play. The pieces can be rotated in 90 degree variations, important to get these tiles into the littlest slots on the field. You can't place same colors on top of each other, but you can place other colors on top of already placed shapes to remove them from play. There are three variations: in \"Puzzle,\" the challenge is to remove all shapes from play with the set amount of pieces. In \"Wipeout\", you've got two minutes to remove all shapes from play with an infinite amount of pieces. And in \"Marathon,\" the challenge is to constantly place and remove shapes as long as you can, trying to keep the session alive as the playfield gets eaten away from the outside in.","total_rating":90,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/it-s-mr-pants"}
