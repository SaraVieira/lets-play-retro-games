Think you can do any better? Try your hand at plotting out all of the details of the creation and management of a dinosaur park in JURASSIC PARK III: Park Builder. A strategy-simulation title of the highest caliber, the game leaves you in charge of 100 dinosaur species you have the task of placing them and maintaining their health. Of course, there's also the matter of the restaurants, shops, rides, and other attractions. If the park you create is too boring, poorly maintained, or excessively expensive, no one will show up, so you'd better use some seriously discerning judgment. In addition to managing the park, you'll have to pick up DNA strands from throughout the park to create new dinosaurs to keep the people coming back. Does it sound like too much to handle? Just wait until one of your prehistoric pals escapes on opening day.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jurassic-park-iii-park-builder"}
