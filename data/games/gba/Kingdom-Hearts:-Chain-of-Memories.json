The lobby and areas between floors are white with flower-themed decorations, but each floor can be transformed into a different world from the first Kingdom Hearts game using \"world cards\" created from Sora's memories. Like before, many of the worlds are based on Disney films while the rest were created by Square Enix.","summary":"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is the second game in the Kingdom Hearts series.
