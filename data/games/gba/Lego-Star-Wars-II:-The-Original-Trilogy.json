With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II follows the Rebel Alliances crusade to dismantle the Galactic Empire and rebuild a galaxy in pieces.\n\nBuild and battle your way through your favorite film moments, from Darth Vaders pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to a showdown on the second Death Star, as the game includes even more of the family-friendly LEGO action, puzzles and humor that earned the original LEGO Star Wars such\npopularity and acclaim.\n\nAnd much more new to offer, it still has. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. You can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lego-star-wars-ii-the-original-trilogy--1","videos":[{"id":65904,"game":194937,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"XRZTJ35w9Sw","checksum":"81ad0063-f4fc-017f-6ccc-9603d5fbb824"}]}
