The game is based on a frenzied Japanese TV series about kids who build robots and fight them against other kids' robots. It dispenses with the negligible story of the series in favor of the player just going in and kicking ro-butt over and over again against a series of faceless and recognizable foes.","total_rating":79.9126420502612,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/medabots-ax-rokusho-version"}
