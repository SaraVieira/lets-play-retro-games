There are scrolls that the playable character can obtain to perform abilities at the cost of chakra, which can be used to break down walls or create whirlwinds. The story mode very loosely follows the Prologue — Land of Waves arc to the Chuunin Exams arc.\n\nPlayers will have to protect, defend or defeat as they train hard to perfect their skills in order to progress through the ranks in over 40 missions. Players can activate special attacks using the Nintendo DS stylus on the touch screen or by blowing into the microphone, and can choose from 20 of their favourite characters. The game also features four game modes, dual screen and touch pen support, a new interchangeable attack system, and wireless play with up to four players.","total_rating":65.6420496235706,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naruto-ninja-council","videos":[{"id":31539,"game":24066,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"aMax1rVYxcw","checksum":"16ee061a-6476-64cf-081c-8c26851a7124"}]}
