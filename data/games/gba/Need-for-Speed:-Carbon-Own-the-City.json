Unlike the other versions there is no canyon racing or drift racing.\n\nThe goal of the game is to build up a gang of the best racers and take over all the city's territories. The driving is all city-based similar to the open world of Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The tuner culture/car customization features started in Need for Speed Underground are also present.\n\nThere is a light story, presented as comic book style illustrations, that unfolds as the player take over territories and complete chapters.","total_rating":68.786274518569,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-carbon-own-the-city","videos":[{"id":5018,"game":11639,"name":"Teaser","video_id":"0wKM1-v3StE","checksum":"8e95c20d-adb4-5ed1-d2e9-092cb9bd679a"},{"id":5019,"game":11639,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"7bcCOEKz9iU","checksum":"5150e78c-5aed-3d2a-8dfe-a62d20348660"}]}
