And now the greedy, vile Vykkers Labs have big plans for their fortune and glory through his doom. Meanwhile, veteran Oddworld saviour and outlaw Abe learns he needs Munch's help to save his species from industrial atrocity and vice versa. In an all new 3D oriented world using familiar gameplay, travelling through military bases, factories and the natural world, the two must work together and succeed together to lead the oppressed natives to freedom, decommissioning local police forces and shutting down industrial pollution in order to return balance to Oddworld.","summary":"This port is the Game Boy Advance version of Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. Both Abe and Munch are playable as you use their powers to get past the guards, or use them to your own advantage. Abe's people can also lend a helping hand in fighting off creatures or solving puzzles, while you guide them away from danger. Munch can also control Fuzzles, small critters that can be deadly in packs against enemies.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/oddworld-munchs-oddysee","videos":[{"id":71640,"game":134025,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"X6m5kCs4_uc","checksum":"c2acec3a-c181-bd14-773b-132ad4fbdfc4"}]}
