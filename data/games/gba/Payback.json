It's entirely non-linear - to complete a level you simply have to obtain a certain number of points - how you get those points is entirely up to you; you can do what the local kingpin tells you, uncover secret missions or just go on a mad killing spree.\n\nThis GBA action game takes inspirations from Rockstar/DMA's classic GTA series, but features unique gameplay elements, plus a visually stunning 3D GBA engine full of special effects and a smooth framerate.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/payback"}
