This version, produced by Digital Eclipse, altered the classic titles in order to function within the Game Boy Advance's resolution. Strangely, the bundle omitted the fan-favorite Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium from its selection of games, only offering Phantasy Star, Phantasy Star II, and Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasy-star-collection--1"}
