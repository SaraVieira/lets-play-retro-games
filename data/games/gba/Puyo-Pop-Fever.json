Better known in the west under the titles Puyo Pop, Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Puyo Pop Fever still follows the classic bubble-popping format (align four or more \"puyos\" to make them pop), but Sega also delivers completely overhauled visuals with a more hand-drawn look, an expanded roster of characters, and a new \"Fever Mode\" that cranks up the action to frantic degrees once players fill a \"fever gauge\" on their screen. Although a four-player mode didn't make the cut, two players can go head to head and compete for points or survival.","total_rating":75.40394621454985,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-pop-fever"}
