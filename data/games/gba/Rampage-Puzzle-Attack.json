Once a Detoblock (a block that is different in appearance to the usual blocks) appears, drop it onto the corresponding colour to clear those blocks from the field. \n \nPlay modes include Clear (clean the playfield of all blocks), Puzzle (try and clear all blocks within a set number of drops), Marathon (the usual play as far as you can mode) and Rescue Mode, where you must clear the blocks from the top of a cage, in which the many monsters from the arcade hit, Rampage World Tour, are trapped in.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rampage-puzzle-attack"}
