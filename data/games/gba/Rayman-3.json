The group eventually gains enough hair from various animals throughout the forest to dress themselves as scarecrow-like Hoodlums. In the middle of the process, Murfy, one of the residents and workers of the Fairy Council, discovers them. André later discovers him hiding nearby, and he and his Black Lums pursue him. Murfy is chased to a small clearing, where Rayman and his friend Globox are sound asleep. Just after Murfy reaches them, Globox is awakened by the commotion. Now aware of the situation, Globox helps Murfy to try and get Rayman, who is still asleep, to safety. In the process, Globox accidentally removes Rayman's hands, forcing Murfy to pick Rayman up by his hair and fly him away from the clearing himself. In an attempt to save himself, Globox runs away to safety, taking Rayman's hands along with him.","summary":"Just like its Game Boy predecessors, Rayman 3 is mostly a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The main goal is to reach the end of a level, but there are various items to collect which all count towards the 100% completion. Some of those items can only be collected by re-visiting the level with additional abilities which are learned during the course of the game. Additionally there are two 3D mini games involving jet skiing and kart racing.","total_rating":35,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-3","videos":[{"id":37149,"game":49843,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"esn6mY99Wdk","checksum":"e94750bc-6a74-ccf2-0c6b-c0e368535832"}]}
