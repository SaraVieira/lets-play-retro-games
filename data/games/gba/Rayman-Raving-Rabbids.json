With the help of Murfy, he manages to get his hands back and escape the jail, but not before fighting Pink's new toy: a giant Antitoon-like machine. After defeating it, Ly comes and gives Rayman a Gangsta costume which he can use to stomp the ground. At the village, Ly tells Rayman how the Rabbids used to be sweet, innocent creatures who were so kind the other animals made fun of them. Eventually the Rabbids could not take this anymore and planned their revenge. Rayman travels through five different worlds, beating the Rabbids and collecting more costumes, and eventually faces the Rabbids' Mothership. Rayman stops the mothership and brings peace back to the valley.","summary":"Rayman Raving Rabbids is a 2D sidescrolling platform game that was released exclusively for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. With a traditional adventure story and gameplay that is almost identical to that of Rayman 3 on the Game Boy Advance, it stands in sharp contrast to the other iterations of Rayman Raving Rabbids, almost all of which are minigame-based party games. It is the last game in the Rayman series to be released for the Game Boy Advance, and the only Rabbids game for the system.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-raving-rabbids--1"}
