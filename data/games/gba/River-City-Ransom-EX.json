Within a few months, the brothers take control of the neighboring high schools using powerful fighting techniques, striking fear as the \"Double Dragon Brothers\". Riki, the banchou of Hanazono High School has no interest in the brothers or what they have been doing. But one day his girlfriend Mami goes missing and he receives a challenge from the academy. Enraged, Riki decides to make his way to the academy alone, but finds Kunio waiting for him outside his school. Kunio wants to help Riki rescue his girlfriend and he begrudgingly agrees.","summary":"The classic NES game returns with improved graphics and even more role-playing action. As in the original game, River City Ransom for the Game Boy Advance blends action, fighting, and role-playing elements into one game. You'll play one of two young heroes who must battle their way past city gangs and then defeat the gang lord to free the students of River City High. More than just a side-scrolling fighting game, River City Ransom EX features a character-building system and customization options.\n\nThe Western version is a regional port of the Japanese version, since it uses the same storyline and identities of River City Ransom, instead of the stablished characters from Downtown Nekketsu Story and the Kunio-kun franchise.","total_rating":91,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/river-city-ransom-ex","videos":[{"id":47412,"game":24135,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"46D6OcENygo","checksum":"bb7006c2-1ad7-dfab-3266-cd3c09536655"}]}
