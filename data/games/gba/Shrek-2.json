Shrek is on a journey to meet his in-laws, so Shrek 2 follows his adventure to Far Away Land and the chaos that ensues once Fiona's parents learn that their precious daughter is an ogre -- and is married to the crudest of them all. Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a \"Burro Blast\" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.","total_rating":60.58536215865915,"total_rating_count":52,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shrek-2","videos":[{"id":4532,"game":3668,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vu0lZDrkVDo","checksum":"ba7b9de2-2631-318a-4bb0-eb2e1cc8f4e3"}]}
