With the help of the ultimate weapon, No.012X Imamio Thunder, you have to blast away enemies and save the world in this port of the oft-forgotten classic Hot-B shooter for the Genesis. The game's strategy system features the ability to level up your two chooseable ships independently as you progress, and the original's throwback ship designs and frantic every-direction shooting gameplay is preserved in this remake.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/steel-empire--1"}
