They are faced with rows of advancing bubbles of different colors. They can launch bubbles of their own. The idea is to create a row, column or stack of 3 or more bubbles. When that happens, they will pop. Each character has their own favorite bubble color and when they pop them, color energy is transferred to their special jar. Once the jar is full, the player can unleash their super special attack. During the puzzles, the player is also provided with nine different special attacks that they can obtain by getting special bubbles. The current special attack the player has is displayed on a wheel called the Torus.\n\nThe game consists of 3 different 1 player difficulty modes along with a training mode, each having 50 levels of bubble popping puzzles and a 2 player mode that allows a player to compete for the higher score against a friend. Each level is allowed to be won by popping all of the bubbles or by collecting a certain amount of Level Stars.","total_rating":38,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bubble-pop","videos":[{"id":52254,"game":4187,"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"p5wiE3mxoag","checksum":"d0351f5d-c3a6-404c-07a8-36f3bb532b5f"}]}
