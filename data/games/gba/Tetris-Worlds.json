Tetris Worlds continues that streak, bringing their distinct brand of simple, yet addictive gameplay to the current generation of systems. Small shapes called Tetraminoes fall from the top of the screen to the bottom and you must rotate them and fit them together to complete lines. The game features six different variations of the classic Tetris, multiplayer mode for up to four players, and six different worlds. Sound easy? Once you start, you can't stop.","total_rating":48.25,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris-worlds"}
