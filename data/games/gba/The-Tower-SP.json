Your goal is to make your tenants happy, collect greater investment funds and expand your tower upwards. This isn't as easy as it seems, as you have to keep your tenants' stress level down or they'll take flight and leave you with vacancies and unpaid dept. As the building manager, you have lots of responsibilities. You have to make sure elevator access is smooth, perhaps making use of more funds to install new elevators. You even have to clean the toilets by pressing the A button real fast. Listening to your tenant's opinions is also important, and the game offers a quick way of viewing complaints and comments from your tenants in real time.","total_rating":8,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-tower-sp"}
