When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, and get a feel for the level, without the hassle of any goals or time limits. When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, and then receive the goal. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collecting SKATE and getting a certain amount of points.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4"}
