Three of the sports renditions, skiing, snowboarding, and bobsled, utilize an ambitious 3D engine for a realistic you-are-there feel. In Skiing, players rush down the different slopes in order to beat the best time, while Snowboarding requires players to pull off tricks to score points. Bobsled puts players in the ice-riding vehicle, where they must keep the sled on the optimal groove of the course to get the fastest time and Curling is like ice bowling or shuffleboard. Features 10 courses for each event and link-up play for two.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-winter-games"}
