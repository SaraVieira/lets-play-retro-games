The reason? The Fairy World had been seized by demons. Woody?s interest is sparked when he learns that there is a treasure chest waiting in the legendary castle of the Fairy World. But to reach the castle Woody has to first free the five worlds of the elements of nature.\n\nThe five element worlds are each separately made up of fire, water, wind, sand and wood. Each world has its own different features, its own mysterious castle, occupied by a demon that has one element key. Once Woody has gathered all five keys, the legendary Crazy Castle appears. Woody must face the same types of challenges he faced in previous five worlds as he heads toward the throne to meet the demon that occupies Crazy Castle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/woody-woodpecker-in-crazy-castle-5","videos":[{"id":51476,"game":8012,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"pdovj2OQCLY","checksum":"de30947f-2a1a-4e07-f7e3-4512c98258e2"}]}
