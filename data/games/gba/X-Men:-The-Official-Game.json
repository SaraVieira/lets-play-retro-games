The game covers the events of the films X2: X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand, specifically following the characters of Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler. It also bridges the gap between the two films, explaining why Nightcrawler is not present for The Last Stand, and also introduces new foes to the X-Men film canon, such as HYDRA, who FOX didn't own the film rights to. The only further reference to HYDRA in the X-Men film series would be the appearance of Bob, Agent of HYDRA in Deadpool, though the character's ties to HYDRA are not referenced.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-the-official-game--1"}
