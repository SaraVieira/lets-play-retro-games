As players demonstrate their virtual riding skills, addition options are unlocked to challenge them further. Publisher XS Games drafted DC Studios to develop the game. Featuring 12 different tracks and four bikes, XS Moto runs on the same engine and technology built for Majesco's Cartoon Network Speedway. In addition to standard racing game controls, the game also features a bike-specific gameplay element. The upper corner indicates a \"balance\" meter that flashes when players get close to falling off their bikes, and to stay up players must use both the L and R with the D-pad during turns.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xs-moto"}
