The population, divided between good and evil, uses gargantuan life forms called Zoids to battle each other for control of this world. During a recent weapons experiment, Planet Zi underwent an accidental time-space fusion, creating a collision of Zoids warriors from two eras, the Chaotic Century and the New Century. Now, all hopes of returning Planet Zi to normal rest with Zeru, a promising Zoids warrior. Help Van, Fiona, Bit Cloud and Zeru use the full power of the ZOIDS to bring peace to their world. As the story unfolds, players can customize and upgrade their own unique Zoids to improve its efficiency and perform combination attack moves. Released in Japan as Zoids Saga II, Legacy features more than 140 different types of Zoids, each can be customized with different weapons and new color schemes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zoids-legacy"}
