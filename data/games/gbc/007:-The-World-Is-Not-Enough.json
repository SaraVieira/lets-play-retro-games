In contrast to the Nintendo 64 and Playstation versions, this game only has eight missions and features a 2D overhead view instead of a 3D first-person. There is no multiplayer, no difficulty levels, and no save feature. Passwords are used to skip to later levels and unlock certain cheats.","total_rating":72.8609685220385,"total_rating_count":32,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/james-bond-007-the-world-is-not-enough"}
