The player takes control of Action Man as they travel through seven different levels ranging for jungles to the Arctic, battling an army of robots with a variety of weapons and battle suits in search of Base X and stop Dr. X from launching a terrifying new weapon that could very well bring an end to the world.\n\nThe gameplay is a standard side-scrolling action platformer where the player advances throughout the level, destroying enemies and avoiding pit falls. Along the way they can pick up more powerful guns as well as a bow and arrow and even different suits that can help them on their quest.
