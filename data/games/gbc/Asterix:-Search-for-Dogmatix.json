And the dozen or so mini-games in \"instant fun\" mode are sure to keep your fingers busy between two stations on the underground.\n\nThere's a catch, though: to access the whole set of mini-games, you have to win Bonus Tokens by playing in \"adventure\" mode. By Belenos, this is a game for the truly indomitable!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/asterix-search-for-dogmatix"}
