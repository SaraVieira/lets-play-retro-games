Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.","summary":"A port of the 1998 PlayStation 3D remake, Asteroids on the Game Boy Color is a 2D version that comes much closer to the original title.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/asteroids--3","videos":[{"id":50038,"game":150203,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"zbULICXrgg4","checksum":"02a38267-b533-0311-a462-90297f53ff3e"}]}
