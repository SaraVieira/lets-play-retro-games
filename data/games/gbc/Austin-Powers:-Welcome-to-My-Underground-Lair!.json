This game turns your Game Boy Color into a mini-organizer, complete with a word processor (the Evil Launch Pad), a calculator (the Frickulator), and a mockup web browser that contains facts about the popular movies. Looking for something a bit more game-related? Well, AUSTIN POWERS has those in spades, too. The largest of the games, \"Kin-Evil,\" has Dr. Evil and Mini-Me riding their scooter through a variety of stunt-packed stages. Also available for your enjoyment are the \"Mojo Maze,\" a takeoff on PAC-MAN, \"Domination,\" a board game similar to OTHELLO, and finally \"Rock or Paper or Scissors,\" which pits you against an AUSTIN POWERS character in a play of the classic game. Customize the backdrop of all this fun by choosing wallpaper, screensavers, sound effects, and more. You can also link up to play some of the games with a friend or foe using either AUSTIN POWERS: Oh Behave! or AUSTIN POWERS: Welcome to My Underground Lair.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/austin-powers-welcome-to-my-underground-lair"}
