She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls. Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.\n\nCasper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare \"Fleshies\" and thwart Casper's efforts. The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.","total_rating":55.4659928241437,"total_rating_count":17,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/casper"}
