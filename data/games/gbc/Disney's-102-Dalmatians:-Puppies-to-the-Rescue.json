The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure.\n\nEach level has its own individual tasks—completing a chore, defeating a henchmen, solving a puzzle, etc. -- which will also grant stickers. There are six stickers per a level, excluding Cruella levels, which combine together with mini games for their own sticker image.","summary":"Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue is a platform game loosely based on the live-action Disney movie 102 Dalmatians.
