There are two modes of play. In the first you play on a big game board, where each square represents a Disney character. When you land on a square you play a mini-game against or inspired by him or her. For instance if you land on the square showing the inventor father you will have to play a game where his new log chopping device cuts firewood and he has to bounce it across the screen on a spring. These mini-games range from 2D platform game segments to memory or reflex games. There are a total of seven boards to play on. You can play with up to four players.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-beauty-and-the-beast-a-board-game-adventure"}
