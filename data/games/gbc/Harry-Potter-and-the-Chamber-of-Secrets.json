It follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics. In this game, Harry is joined by Ron and Hermione in the battles. While Harry can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have special attacks unique to each other. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added. Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets--4","videos":[{"id":54264,"game":117322,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"vg4KHZ5LQRw","checksum":"9e3be5aa-9bff-f629-f408-01e2c5b91fe0"}]}
