Think again; INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR SOCCER 99 has all of the rules, physics, and intensity of the real thing. You can play as any of 32 worldwide squads, competing for the rights to the International Cup. Choose whether you want to play three, five, or seven-minute halves, and decide whether you want your overtime decisions to be made Golden Goal or Extended Time-style. The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world. Beginners and seasoned veterans alike will get plenty of mileage out of the game, as there are three different difficulty settings to master.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-99"}
