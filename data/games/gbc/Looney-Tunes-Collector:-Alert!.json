In doing so, K-9 accidentally threw out 10 pieces of the teleporter that are required to execute Marvin's plan to destroy the Earth. Bugs Bunny happens to overhear the Martian's plan, and now he must travel throughout the world and collect the other Looney Tunes characters 47 in all. While Bugs can perform basic tasks, solving all of the game's puzzles and collecting all 10 teleporter pieces requires the special skills and talents of each character. For example, Elmer Fudd can blast obstacles with his gun, while Daffy Duck can swim and dive into deep water. Learning how and when to use each character is the key to success in LOONEY TUNES COLLECTOR: Alert!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/looney-tunes-collector-alert"}
