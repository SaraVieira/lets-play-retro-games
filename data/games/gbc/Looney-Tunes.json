The player can use Daffy Duck (throwing a frisbee to defeat enemies with Mario-style gameplay), Tweety Bird (elude Sylvester throughout the level), Porky Pig (control a bi-plane to shoot down enemies), Taz (really only a bonus game in which he has to collect as many steaks as possible in 60 seconds), Speedy Gonzalez (elude ghosts and ghouls in a haunted mansion), Roadrunner (of course running from his arch enemy, Wile E. Coyote) and finally Bugs Bunny (gameplay similar to Daffy).","total_rating":66,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/looney-tunes"}
