This is an unconventional arcade-style racer where the tiny vehicles are seen from a top-down perspective. There are no pit stops to plan for, nor is there oil pressure for you to worry about--just motorized mayhem on a miniature scale. Identical in gameplay, each game in Micro Machines 1 & 2: Twin Turbo offers 24 unique tracks that, from your microperspective, seem enormous! You'll race around gigantic breakfast tables, bathtubs, desks, and gardens. With simple gameplay and quirky, colorful graphics, this game should appeal to gamers of all ages.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/micro-machines-1-and-2-twin-turbo"}
