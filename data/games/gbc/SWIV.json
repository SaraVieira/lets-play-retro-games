As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also includes a mid-level enemy inspired by the \"Goose\" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the \"goose\" would drop power-ups.","total_rating":82.1836402683148,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/swiv","videos":[{"id":23056,"game":12789,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"7E8ueEVJv-Y","checksum":"855a9f0b-1781-2fb5-d102-b6501ef74ed5"},{"id":23057,"game":12789,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"ULzHgRWdlf4","checksum":"1784f0da-76ba-1b1e-edbe-d0c2e96d6351"}]}
