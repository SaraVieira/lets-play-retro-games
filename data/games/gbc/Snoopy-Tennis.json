Choose from an initial selection of four characters Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus, and Lucy and take to one of four courts: clay, hard, and two different grass courts. Five gameplay modes await you: in Normal mode you play a quick best-of-three or best-of-five match up against a computer or human opponent; Sudden Win gives you an instant victory if you gain two games on your opponent; in Point Race mode, you'll race to see how many points you can score in a minute; Special mode throws a variety of power-ups into the mix; and Championship mode has you battling several opponents in order to become champion and unlock four new characters and courts.
