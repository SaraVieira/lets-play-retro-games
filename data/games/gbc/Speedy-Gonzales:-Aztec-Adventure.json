To get all the mice back, Speedy must collect the cheese in 18 different stages. However, the cheese will not be easy to collect, as along the way Speedy will have to make death-defying jumps while avoiding spikes, lava, and bottomless pits. In addition to those hazards, there are a number of enemies that are glad the mice are gone and don't want Speedy to rescue them. As luck would have it, there are power-ups and weapons scattered throughout the stages. After completing several stages, Speedy will have to face and defeat a boss character. Will Speedy be able to collect all of the cheese and defeat his enemies? Find out by playing SPEEDY GONZALES: Aztec Adventure.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/speedy-gonzales-aztec-adventure"}
