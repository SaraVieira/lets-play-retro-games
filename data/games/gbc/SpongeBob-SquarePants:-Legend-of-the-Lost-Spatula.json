As the wacky-but-popular character from the TV cartoon you'll head out on an undersea quest to find the Flying Dutchman's Golden Spatula in order to become the ocean's greatest short-order cook. More than 10 stages full of adventure and side-scrolling action make up this epic treasure hunt. Along the way, you'll meet and interact with many of the show's popular recurring characters like Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy Cheeks, and Patrick Star. Keep an eye out for hidden clues to the Golden Spatula's whereabouts as you make your way through each stage, but also be wary of enemies and obstacles. Colorful cutscenes tell the story between levels, and you can use the password system to save your progress through the game. SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS: Legend of the Lost Spatula is only compatible with Game Boy Color systems.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spongebob-squarepants-legend-of-the-lost-spatula"}
