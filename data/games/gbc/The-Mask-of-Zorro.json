The people need a hero, and that is when Zorro appears. You take the role of Zorro, using your sword and cunning to fight your way through 30 levels of action, exploring towns and mines and facing many treacherous enemies. Every wound you receive depletes Zorro's life bar a little bit, but finding hearts or kissing Elena, Zorro's beloved and Don Rafael's daughter, will allow Zorro to regain his health. A soundtrack of Spanish guitar rhythms will make you think that you are in 1820s California.
