This deity, Quaxet, was imprisoned by the combined efforts of the Mayan, Aztec and Inca cultures, and now some nasty treasure seekers are looking to spoil it all by unleashing the evil. Having knowledge of this, Lara must set out to prevent the disaster from happening by finding the stone first.","summary":"Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game released for the Game Boy Color. This release is significant as it is the first portable game in the Tomb Raider series. This version has the standard Tomb Raider gameplay of running, jumping and switch-flipping, but presented in a side-view 2D style, reminiscent of Flashback. At Lara's disposal are 25 or so moves, which are crammed onto the 2 GBC buttons. There are also game-save crystals at special points throughout the levels. Although it shares its title with the first entry in the series, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color follows a different storyline.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider--1","videos":[{"id":53525,"game":36878,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"kA3Q8CErcEg","checksum":"f30a148e-c1f0-f08f-49ff-d4b8ca3f1861"}]}
