It bears little resemblance to the original Playstation version. It is composed of two events: a half pipe and a race mode.\n\nHalf pipe mode is viewed from a side perspective, similar to the classic Skate or Die game. You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you aim to perform tricks and get to the end quickly.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater--1"}
