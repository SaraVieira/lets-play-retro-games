All of the other wrestlers have conspired against you, kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, and stolen the WWF Heavyweight Title belt. Choose to play as the Rock, Triple H, the Undertaker, or Stone Cold Steve Austin in this story-based wrestling game. You'll roam the streets, taking down thugs and seeking out valuable information along your journey to redemption. There'll be plenty of objects to pick up and throw, scenery to destroy, and havoc to wreak, but the only weapons you'll be given are your own bare fists and a solid pair of boots. Other weapons (steel pipes, cakes, and mailboxes) are available, though you'll have to defeat a few foes to earn them. Tons of power-ups are strewn throughout the game, but you'll be lucky if you can free up the time and energy to get to them. Awesome graphics, tough boss characters, and a great story make this one unique wrestling title.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wwf-betrayal"}
