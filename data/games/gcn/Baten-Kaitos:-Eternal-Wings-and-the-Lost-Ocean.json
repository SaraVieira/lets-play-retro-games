People live now on islands which are floating high in the skies. They also have wings - \"Wings of the Hearts\" - growing on their backs. Kalas is a young man who was born only with one wing - he replaces the second with an artificial wing manufactured by great masters. He is on a quest to find the murderers of his grandfather and his brother. He meets a girl named Xelha, who is out to stop an evil conspiracy that threatens the country, and they join forces against the newly appeared evil.","summary":"An original roleplaying game for Nintendo GameCube from the team behind Xenosaga. The game makes heavy use of cards for everything from fighting battles to purchasing items. Cards are actually a central part of the story as well, as they are holders for \"Magnus\" which is short for \"Magna Essence.\" Magnus is the true nature of all things throughout the world, including swords, magic spells and even apples that are gathered in the town in which your adventures start out. A real item can be turned into Magnus form and stored in a blank card. It can then be taken out from the card and will turn back into real form. Features detailed CG cutscenes to tell the story and turn-based battle sequences.","total_rating":83.8378038127357,"total_rating_count":17,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baten-kaitos-eternal-wings-and-the-lost-ocean","videos":[{"id":59990,"game":3795,"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"9vgCdUmlsJU","checksum":"e5e569ac-bdff-4c7e-ce80-74b0e5a9386b"},{"id":59991,"game":3795,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"YDHwLzObg7o","checksum":"74740ff2-9fce-93e5-ea90-26664a1d8731"}]}
