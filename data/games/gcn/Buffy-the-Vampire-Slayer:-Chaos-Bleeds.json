On this occasion (set as a 'missing episode' from the TV series' fifth season), the powerful vampire Kakistos and The First are ready for war, and the only ones standing in their way is Buffy the Vampire Slayer and her friends Willow (an at times powerful witch), Faith (a fellow Slayer), Spike (former evil vampire turned slightly good) and Xander (caught in the middle of his best friends work).\n\nYou get the chance to play as each character during the game as you slay vampires, solve puzzles and collect items along the way to prepare you for the final showdown. Various other characters from the show appear to help you out, while some are out to hurt you big time.\n\nMultiplayer options are also included for up to 4 players. Go rabbit hunting in Bunny Catch; be the last person standing against wave after wave of vamps in Survival or battle for control of the arena in Domination.","total_rating":66.75,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-chaos-bleeds","videos":[{"id":51614,"game":3837,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"M5HJC2s6RHg","checksum":"3410aebe-c67d-7917-c0d7-019a1eb62836"}]}
