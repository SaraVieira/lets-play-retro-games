Like all other home versions of the game, CvS2: EO also contains four bonus characters: Evil Ryu, Orochi Iori, Shin Akuma (Shin Gouki in Japan), and Ultimate Rugal (God Rugal in Japan), powered-up versions of four regular characters.\n\nBefore selecting a team, the game offers a selection of \"Grooves\", which change the way the game is played, as well as \"AC-ism\" or \"GC-ism\" Grooves; GC-ism simplifies the control scheme, originally designed for the GameCube gamepad. In the Xbox version it is called EO-ism. Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO also removed the Roll Cancel glitch that was in the original versions. In addition, the Xbox version of CvS2: EO also included online play for up to two players on Xbox Live as well as progressive-scan (480p) support, which was noticeably absent in the PlayStation 2 version.","total_rating":73,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/capcom-vs-snk-2-eo","videos":[{"id":36541,"game":86343,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"cj2P7xLUiXo","checksum":"b3698d9e-7cbd-7f9d-8cb1-bbc0e3fa1a09"},{"id":36542,"game":86343,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"licecu0QnMw","checksum":"9c45f0b9-ad1a-c12d-bc5e-520a35a1462b"},{"id":36546,"game":86343,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"TSOtQDwzQJY","checksum":"9bdca12e-d7a3-5201-6101-b48a1b7475dd"}]}
