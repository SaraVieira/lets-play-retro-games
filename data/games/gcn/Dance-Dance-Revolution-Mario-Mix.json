Mario must recover them before the chaos destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom! The path to the keys is simple: Left, Right, Up, Down, Right, Down ...Characters include Mario, Luigi, Toad, Waluigi, Wario, Bowser. Players clear levels by performing the correct steps. Once they clear all the levels in a particular world, they'll collect a Music Key. Collect all the Music Keys to win. Players control Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix by stepping on different arrows on the Action Pad (included with game). Players can finally experience the thrill of stomping Goombas and other enemies firsthand.
