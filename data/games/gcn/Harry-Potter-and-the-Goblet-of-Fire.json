Over the course of the school year, he must learn the spells and tricks necessary for him to be able to get through three difficult tasks and, ultimately, escape the clutches of infamous evil wizard Lord Voldemort.","summary":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth title in the Harry Potter franchise. It has a unique feel and gameplay with elements not present in any other game of the franchise, including a camera of a 3D environment that is not player-controlled and a system in which previous levels can be played again at will. Due to higher-quality graphics in comparison to previous Harry Potter video games, characters more closely resemble their movie counterparts. It was also the first Harry Potter game to feature a multiplayer mode.","total_rating":59.7325661894872,"total_rating_count":104,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire","videos":[{"id":17474,"game":3942,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"mhvMEYukEBI","checksum":"3693ad28-5c53-1311-d71e-924c5464a8cd"},{"id":17475,"game":3942,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"j1lqxO-ri0o","checksum":"e00115a9-9896-48c7-8ceb-b1c007e134cd"}]}
