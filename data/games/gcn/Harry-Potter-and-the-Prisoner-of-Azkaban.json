The big change this time is that Ron and Hermione have been promoted to playable, allowing you to play as all three members of the trio. They each have different abilities, and, depending on the platform, you either can or can't decide when to switch characters. Another difference is that Quidditch is no longer playable, with flights on Buckbeak replacing it for the requisite flying mechanic. Perhaps due to the source material being more emotional and less action-oriented, â€‹The Stations of the Canon are mostly just skimmed over.","total_rating":88.6635529415106,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban--2","videos":[{"id":54270,"game":96159,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Mb34COrhyFM","checksum":"7060d6d8-9326-cb8a-1aa3-685d203a80e2"}]}
