This compilation includes 20 games that were not in the 2003 release of Midway Arcade Treasures or the 2005 release of Midway Arcade Treasures 3.\n\nThe game plays similar on all three consoles, though the Xbox version has the exclusive ability to upload scores to an online scoreboard. The Xbox version, however, is not compatible with the Xbox 360. The special features on each version of the game are the same. These include game histories, developer interviews, and other documents.","total_rating":60.5,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/midway-arcade-treasures-2"}
