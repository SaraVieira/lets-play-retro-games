For the first time in the series' long-running history Blitz will feature a slew of realistic NFL elements mixed with the fast-paced and action-centered gameplay that fans have come to know and love. New 11-on-11 gameplay takes the action to the pro-level; making it possible to include every player, team and position. An extensive new ten-season Franchise Mode allows gamers to experience player trading and drafting, and improved graphics and animations take advantage of motion-capture technology; making those bone-crunching hits painfully realistic.","total_rating":53,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-blitz-pro"}
