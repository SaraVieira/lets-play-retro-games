The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but \"won't take 'no' for an answer.\" The player races off — despite Samantha's warnings — only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.","total_rating":81.0945033258988,"total_rating_count":587,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-underground-2","videos":[{"id":13768,"game":97,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Xl38fecVFzU","checksum":"5848b0fb-9905-f2a8-f050-fb218f95322d"}]}
