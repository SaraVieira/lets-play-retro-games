Pokémon Box itself is not so much a game as it is a storage system for Trainers' Pokémon.\n\nTrainers can store up to 1,500 Pokémon in twenty-five boxes that hold 60 Pokémon each and trade between Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, as well as FireRed and LeafGreen. All of the Pokémon can be stored on a GameCube memory card, requiring the full 59 blocks for save data. A special edition Ruby and Sapphire Memory Card 59 is included with most versions of the game for players to use (the European version just comes with a normal memory card).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-box-ruby-and-sapphire--1"}
