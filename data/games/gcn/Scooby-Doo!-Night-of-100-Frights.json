Night of 100 Frights","slug":"scooby-doo-night-of-100-frights","summary":"Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights is a third person platform game with action elements that was developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox consoles. The game was first released on May 20, 2002 in North America and was released later that year in PAL regions. It is the first Scooby-Doo! video game title to come to sixth generation consoles. The game became a Greatest Hits title in 2003.[1] The game had a follow up titled Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem.\n\nThe game puts players in the control of Scooby-Doo in a story that revolves around him searching for the rest of the gang around a haunted mansion after they're kidnapped by an eccentric villain. The game has twelve areas, ranging from graveyards and secret labs to fishing villages and haunted mazes.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, mainly criticizing the game's simplicity, although its massive environments staying true to the Scooby-Doo! universe was praised by critics and fans alike. Fans of the original show loved the game, feeling it was compensation for the N64 game released in 2000. The game also marks the first and only time Don Knotts did voice work for a video game, though he did do previous voice work in the Scooby-Doo universe.[2]","total_rating":64.1052789651697,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/scooby-doo-night-of-100-frights","videos":[{"id":22438,"game":2860,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"E1lFC0ORk4U","checksum":"b0f5286d-c0bf-3be1-6cfa-438b4fa360ca"}]}
