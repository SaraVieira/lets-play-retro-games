The robots were created by Plankton, the evil genius owner of the Chum Bucket, who has built a new machine called the Duplicatotron 3000 to produce an army ofjeremih to take over the world using these robots, but only after he creates them does he realizes that the switch on the Duplicatotron has accidentally been switched to \"Don't Obey\" and the robots quickly kick him out of the Chum Bucket before taking over it.\n\nSpongeBob and Patrick were playing with toy robots and wish they would with real robots. Patrick uses his \"magic wishing shell\" to make their wish come true, hoping they will show up tomorrow. SpongeBob wakes up to find that his house has been trashed after thinking he wants to play with a robot. He wanders through the house for a while and receives a fax from Mr. Krabs, stating that he would give SpongeBob a golden spatula for every certain amount of shiny objects he collects for him. Outside, SpongeBob finds a disappointed Plankton, who weaves a tale of lies to the hero, claiming that the robots showed up out of nowhere and kicked him out. Fooled by the diminutive villain, SpongeBob embarks on a perilous quest to find golden spatulas, get rid of the robots, trading shiny objects to Mr. Krabs for golden spatulas, searching for Patrick's stolen socks (that had been taken by the robots) who will give him golden spatulas if he brings back ten socks, and getting Plankton back into the Chum Bucket, including bungee jumping, bubble blowing, learning new bubble moves from Bubble Buddy, and traveling through dreams amongst others.","summary":"Bikini Bottom is under attack by robots!
