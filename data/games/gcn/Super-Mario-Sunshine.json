High above, seagulls turn lazy circles in a clear blue sky. This is Isle Delfino.\n\nFar from the hustle and bustle of the Mushroom Kingdom, this island resort glitters like a gem in the waters of a southern sea.\n\nMario, Peach, and an entourage of Toads have come to Isle Delfino to relax and unwind. At least, that’s their plan…but when they arrive, they find things have gone horribly wrong...\n\nAccording to the island inhabitants, the person responsible for the mess has a round nose, a thick mustache, and a cap…\n\nWhat? But…that sounds like Mario!!\n\nThe islanders are saying that Mario's mess has polluted the island and caused their energy source, the Shine Sprites, to vanish.\n\nNow the falsely accused Mario has promised to clean up the island, but...how?\n\nNever fear! FLUDD, the latest invention from Gadd Science, Inc., can help Mario tidy up the island, take on baddies, and lend a nozzle in all kinds of sticky situations.\n\nCan Mario clean the island, capture the villain, and clear his good name? It’s time for another Mario adventure to get started!","summary":"Super Mario Sunshine is a Mario action-adventure 3D platformer. It follows Super Mario 64, and is the second 3D Mario platformer.
