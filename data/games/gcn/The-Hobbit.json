As in the epic text, the tale begins with a group of nine dwarves recruiting the home-loving hobbit as a master thief for their mission to recover stolen ancestral gold from under the fiery snout of Smaug the dragon. The group head for the Lonely Mountain, stopping along the way to fight it out with a variety of Middle-earth's less-than-friendly inhabitants, such as giant spiders, murderous goblins and bloodthirsty trolls.","summary":"Step into the hairy hobbits' feet of Bilbo Baggins in Vivendi Universal Games' take on Tolkien's prequel to the massive Lord of the Rings trilogy.","total_rating":61.58523899593565,"total_rating_count":24,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-hobbit"}
