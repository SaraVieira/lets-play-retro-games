On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself. Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.","total_rating":75.68722945975236,"total_rating_count":48,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-adventures","videos":[{"id":29123,"game":1034,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"1AZMO5iBeDg","checksum":"c43e4e87-849d-84fc-667c-d4da9110981b"}]}
