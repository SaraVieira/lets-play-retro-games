Master Quest contains largely the same content as the original Ocarina of Time, but with redesigned, more difficult dungeons akin to a Second Quest.\n\nMaster Quest was available on a special bonus disc that also contained the original Ocarina of Time. This disc was given out in limited quantities with preorders of The Wind Waker. Additionally, it was sold packaged with The Wind Waker in some regions. It is also available as a mode in Ocarina of Time 3D after first completing the regular game.\n\nIt was previously developed to be released as an expansion to the original game, via the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive, but that version was cancelled due to the lackluster sales of the hardware.","total_rating":89.9641334440708,"total_rating_count":19,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-master-quest"}
