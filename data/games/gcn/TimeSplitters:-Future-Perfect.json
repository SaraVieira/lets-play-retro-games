He then goes on a mission to go back in time to find a way to stop the TimeSplitters race from being created.","summary":"TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter video game developed by Free Radical Design and published by EA Games for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox video game consoles. \n \nIt is the third game in the TimeSplitters series, after TimeSplitters 2, which was released in 2002 (itself the sequel to TimeSplitters released in 2000).
