The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.","total_rating":73.70017994019011,"total_rating_count":75,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/true-crime-streets-of-la"}
