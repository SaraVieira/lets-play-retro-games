This game features more tracks as well as a brand new weapon system.\nGameplay is similar but slightly different to previous games in the series. XGRA features a wide range of riders, tracks and bikes that can accelerate at an incredibly rapid rate, going from 0 to 300 mph in a matter of seconds. A returning feature is the ability to break sound barrier: upon reaching 750MPH, all sound effects will cut out, except for item collection sound, other tider's taunts, weapons firing, and in-game music.\n\nXGRA allows players to race for 8 different teams, with each team's bike having their own advantages and drawbacks such as Regeneration, Handling, Speed, Acceleration and Shielding.","total_rating":62,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xgra-extreme-g-racing-association"}
