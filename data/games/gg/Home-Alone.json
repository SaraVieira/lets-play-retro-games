He must prevent Harry and Marv, the \"Wet Bandits\", from burglarizing his home, using various household objects as traps and/or weapons. Each version of the game is an example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien, Space Panic, and Lode Runner.","summary":"Harry and Marv, the bumbling \"Wet Bandits,\" have paid their debt to society and are now ready to get revenge on the youngster that caused them their humiliating defeat Kevin McCallister. They have arranged for Kevin's family to be out of the house when they come calling again, leaving him home alone for their rematch. This time, the sneaky thieves have beefed up their gang with robbers and crooks that are more than eager to help themselves to the McCallister valuables. Only the resourceful Kevin stands between the new Wet Bandit gang and his family's fortune.","total_rating":54.9688993100625,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/home-alone","videos":[{"id":7695,"game":4523,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"JJghFOyHzFo","checksum":"401eef43-103e-866e-bdff-c2315f3e374d"}]}
