For the past 9 of these tournaments, Shang Tsung's four-armed mutant bodyguard Goro has won all of them. Should he win the tenth, Earth will be left at the mercy of Shang Tsung's Outworld. Playable characters include Raiden, the Thunder God invited to fight in the tournament, in human (and thus killable) form; Liu Kang, a Shaolin monk determined to stop Shang Tsung; Johnny Cage, a Hollywood movie star who wants the publicity; Sonya Blade, a US Special Forces agent; Kano, a tyrant being pursued by Sonya Blade; Sub-Zero, a mercenary ninja with orders to assassinate Shang Tsung and Scorpion, a murdered ninja who has been brought back from the dead to try and kill Sub-Zero, the man who murdered him.","summary":"Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling fighting game. Fighting is set as one-on-one combat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a \"Fatality\" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.","total_rating":75.7733673406133,"total_rating_count":238,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat--2","videos":[{"id":44131,"game":1618,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"6jgrW12Eg_A","checksum":"d9505a54-df0e-de7c-8b0a-a5be83a27247"}]}
