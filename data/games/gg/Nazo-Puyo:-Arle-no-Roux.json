Despite being the third game in the Nazo Puyo subseries, it is drastically different from its prequels, taking a combined RPG/puzzle approach to its (now existent) storyline. It would receive two sequels, both on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Nazo Puyo Rulue no Roux, combining a retooled version of this game with a new story mode focusing on Rulue, and Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki, a new game focusing exclusively on Rulue).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nazo-puyo-arle-no-roux"}
