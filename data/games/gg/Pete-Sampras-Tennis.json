You can choose to play as the (then) world seed 1, Pete Sampras himself or choose from 29 other players.\n\nThe action is viewed from the traditional third-person viewpoint. A tutorial mode is provided to help you get used to the forehand, lob and drop shots on offer. Several venues from all over the world can be played on, on Hard, Grass and Clay courts.\n\nThis was the first and one of the very few Genesis games to be released with a J-Cart, which meant that four-way gameplay was possible without the need of special adapters â€“ the cartridge had two built-in joypad connectors. The Game Gear version was equally inventive, allowing two players to share one Game Gear, or four players to play doubles by linking two machines.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pete-sampras-tennis","videos":[{"id":53416,"game":4434,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"3ZWPuxla99c","checksum":"7723f1d9-1afa-d9d2-0bc6-a1ab8e6411b1"}]}
