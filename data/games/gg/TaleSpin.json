She looks in the newspaper and finds that the Mayor has announced a flying contest with a lifetime work contract to Cape Suzette as the prize. She shows it to the others who then decide to take part. However, Shere Khan of Khan Industries has also taken an interest in the contest. The City Official announces that Higher for Hire and Khan Industries have been selected for the contest with Shere Khan's company going first. They successfully complete their run, giving Higher for Hire only seven days to win. Baloo and Kit must now collect 10 boxes of Cargo from 8 countries around the world, whilst avoiding Shere Khan's henchmen and the air raid attacks of Don Karnage.","summary":"TaleSpin is a game based on the television series of the same name, released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1991 and 1992.
