Some missions require the player to obtain new weapons from an enemy base or destroy other robots.\n\nThe player has a wide variety of weapons like rocket launchers, a chainsaw, gatling gun, shield, and self-controlled rockets, which can be equipped on any part of the robot.\n\nThe gaming media reported that Iron Soldier would support two-player gaming via the Jaguar's dial-up internet link;[1] however, the Jaguar internet link was never completed or released, so Iron Soldier was released as a single-player game only.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-soldier"}
