The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.","total_rating":80.3574992422459,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-fantasies","videos":[{"id":40615,"game":6023,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"7kZ-i9mGav4","checksum":"883a597e-967d-cedc-0acb-2689a7c523d2"}]}
