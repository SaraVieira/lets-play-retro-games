In Ruiner, a double-wide table provides challenging gameplay and real classic arcade feel as you strive to defend your country from a foreign attack and prepare a strike of your own. In Tower, the triple-length table is so eerie you'll think you've descended into Hell. The Sorceress and her wicked minions are after you. Casting three spells will bring the tower crashing down, but can you figure them out before it's too late!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ruiner-pinball"}
