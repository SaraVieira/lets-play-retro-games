There are 3 courses to play: one in the U.K one in the U.S and the third one in Japan. The gameplay involves you lining up your shot via an overhead view which when set up switches to a third person view. Whilst in this view you need to swing the club and stop it at the desired power and then stop it on the correct symbol to get the perfect hit. If you don't get it right you will either miss the ball or hit the earth. There are 14 clubs at your disposal, 8 irons, 3 woods 2 wedges and a putter which are selected by moving the hand cursor over your Golf bag and selecting the desired club.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/awesome-golf","videos":[{"id":50464,"game":12363,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"f7fGulSlXBc","checksum":"a53f47f3-c8b9-f8cd-4f90-13e0f9b33517"}]}
