No wonder the gang members nicknamed this game \"Basketbrawl.\" To them, it's not a game -- it's a street fight. This premise kicks off Atari's action sports game for up to two players. The objective in Basketbrawl is to become the baddest gang in the town by winning the Basketbrawl tournament. To win, you must play three games against each of the five gangs in your city. Each time you move up to the next gang, you will play a team with more players and more dangerous weapons. Each game lasts six minutes -- out score you opponent by shooting more baskets. Each basket is worth two points. If the game is tied after six minutes, the first team to score wins","summary":"Basketbrawl is a sports video game released for the Atari 7800 in 1990, then for the Atari Lynx in 1992. It is a basketball simulation which allows hitting and fighting with other players. The name is a portmanteau of basketball and brawl. It is similar to the 1989 Midway arcade game Arch Rivals which had the tagline \"A basket brawl!\"\n\nAtari released another sports/fighting combo for the Atari 7800 in 1990 as Ninja Golf. Both were in the final 11 games published by Atari for that system in 1990-91 before dropping support.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/basketbrawl","videos":[{"id":50288,"game":11867,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"IxDkLe70JJg","checksum":"ccdf9bfd-ea16-375c-1816-22b3a278e492"},{"id":50289,"game":11867,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"vuZzA_Rifvg","checksum":"76874f05-149b-6aa3-e3f4-4df0365a32ad"}]}
