It was later ported to several other systems and was included in the Windows 3.1 bundle Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 (1992), and the Windows version of the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack (1995), where it found a much larger audience.\n\nThe original game was designed by developer Chuck Sommerville, who also made about a third of the levels. Most of the conversions from the Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images Software in the UK.\n\nThe game was re-released on Steam on May 28, 2015, along with a sequel, Chip's Challenge 2, which was also designed by Sommerville.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chips-challenge--1","videos":[{"id":52397,"game":126287,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Qw4EFHGemfQ","checksum":"4d67688c-78bd-0245-3f17-7b68649d4bd4"}]}
