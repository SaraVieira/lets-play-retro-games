Unlike Scramble, however, there are 51 game areas in total, but the player fights through a subset of them through branches, choosing the next area to visit.\n\nSome aliens will join you when shot (power-ups). Alien bases in each area allow you to repair your weapons and shield, but landing at the wrong time will cause your ship to explode and lose all power-ups.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gates-of-zendocon","videos":[{"id":52136,"game":6035,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"1CA-IvToZcM","checksum":"914c5eb9-4073-3f5f-41a4-6381d8f2c571"}]}
