The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ishido-the-way-of-stones--1","videos":[{"id":51183,"game":126453,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"o93cuoOpIf4","checksum":"82f09284-5069-be55-7d6b-8a2027ebe537"}]}
