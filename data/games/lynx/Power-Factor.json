The virtual reality simulator, in the context of the game's fictional world, recreates Ace's famous historical battle against the Sinlendo Techmods from the parallel dimension of Ceeg that invaded his home universe to recover bomb components in the installations of the Ceegraian Power Station that were necessary to defeat alien race.","summary":"Power Factor is a 1993 side-scrolling action-platform video game developed by Hand Made Software and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe exclusively for the Atari Lynx. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players take control of a character who is in turn playing on a virtual reality simulator assuming the role of Redd Ace, which is recreating his battle against the Sinlendo Techmods by recovering necessary bomb components to defeat the alien race at the Ceegraian Power Station. Its gameplay consists of platforming, exploration and weapons-based combat with a main four-button configuration.\n\nPower Factor originally began as a project intended for the Atari ST that was in development by Red Rat Software under the title Red Ace, which was nearly completed before being left unpublished due to internal issues at the company and its eventual disbandment prior to release, however Hand Made Software would later develop a conversion to the Lynx.\n\nPower Factor has been met with positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release, who praised various aspects of the title such as the unique storyline, graphics and character animation but many felt divided in regards to the sound design and gameplay. In 2005, a ROM image of the original ST version was leaked online.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/power-factor","videos":[{"id":51723,"game":62298,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"mJgDwh85_Ws","checksum":"f8de8ee3-ea95-d5dd-fdb8-3ad8b796643c"}]}
