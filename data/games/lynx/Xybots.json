The first player is \"Major Rock Hardy\" while the second player is \"Captain Ace Gunn\", but their abilities are virtually identical other than movement speed.","summary":"Xybots is a sci-fi shooter with pseudo-3D environments explored from a third-person perspective. The game can be played by one or two players; the two-player mode takes place on a split screen. The hero(es) must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers. It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.","total_rating":70.7883753363497,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xybots"}
