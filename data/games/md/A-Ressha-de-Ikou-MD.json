The game refers to games created by Artdink in 1989 and 1991, which may suggest elements were taken from A Ressha de Ikou II or A Ressha de Ikou III released around that period. \n \nLike most entries in the series, A Ressha de Ikou MD was not released outside of Japan, although A Ressha de Ikou III, rebranded as A-Train was brought to western computers by Maxis, also in 1992.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/a-ressha-de-ikou-md"}
