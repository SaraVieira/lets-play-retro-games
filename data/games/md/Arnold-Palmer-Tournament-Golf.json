Most rounds are standard \"stroke\" play but the seventh and eighth rounds are \"match\" games. Things really get serious when match game ends in a tie, and players move into a sudden death play-off.\n\nDuring the tournament players earn higher skill levels, more knowledgeable caddies, and more power. You'll earn a password at the end of each round of the tournament.","summary":"Select your level of play, and then head for the pro shop to choose between Black Carbon, Glass Fiber, and Ceramic Clubs.\n\nTee off by yourself or play 18 holes with a friend. Besides the One and Two Player modes there's also a practice mode, match play (head to head), and a full-blown international tournament, where you'll stroke it out against 15 competitors.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arnold-palmer-tournament-golf"}
