The goo from the interstellar object contaminates all of the circus' attractions, transforming them into bizarre caricatures of their former selves, with new superpowers.","summary":"Sticks and stones might make him groan, but clay really ticks him off! Bad Mister Frosty is the name, and action is the game. Fists and feet will fly (and other parts) as Frosty and his friends smack it out in head-to-head fighting action.\n\nClayFighter is a fighting game released for the Super NES in November 1993 and later ported to Sega Genesis in June 1994. The game is a parody of Street Fighter. In 2009, the Genesis version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.\n\nA port of ClayFighter for the Atari Jaguar was reportedly in the works by Interplay but it was never released.","total_rating":49.935400226436,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/clayfighter","videos":[{"id":52516,"game":46687,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"KA0wXXsvqkc","checksum":"80e3c8aa-21d0-f205-964b-5689f6a75d5b"}]}
