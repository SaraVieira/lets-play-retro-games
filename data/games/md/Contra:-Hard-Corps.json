The Contra Hard Corps, comprised of Ray Poward, Sheena Etranzi, Brad Fang and Browny, are assigned to the investigation. They discover that retired Major Bahamut is implicated, and that he has conspired with Dr. Geo Mandrake to create a biological weapon using the stolen alien cells, as a form of leverage to overthrow the present government. Through their efforts, the Hard Corps manage to thwart Major Bahamut's plans and restore peace once a more.","summary":"Kickin' cyborg butt... That's what it's all about, dude.

Find high powered weapons such as the homing gun, crush gun, needle laser or mine setter. Do you think you can handle it? Trust me, you can't. You still here? Okay, then get ready for the fight of your life. Pick one of the four heroes and begin your search across many dark levels of doom. The ending changes, depending on the paths you choose - but every pass crosses boss characters that will blow you away.
