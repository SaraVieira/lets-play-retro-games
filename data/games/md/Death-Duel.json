As I step through the fleshy remains of my previous opponent, I realize the metal behemoth I am about to face is more fiercely equipped with deadly roto-bore proton rockets.\n\nI know I represent our final hope as I mount the Federation's newest war machine... the A-7 Trinity Rote Cyborg.\n\nThe signal is given...

Today, death is in the air, and mercy in my guns... so LET 'EM BEG FOR MERCY. - Barrett Jade\n\nIT BRINGS ...A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO DISARM YOUR ENEMY.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/death-duel"}
