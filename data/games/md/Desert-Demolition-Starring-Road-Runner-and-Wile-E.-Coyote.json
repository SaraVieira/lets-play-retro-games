Coyote in this unique side-scroller that is just like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon. \n \nYour goal: run through six different desert environments before time expires, collecting ACME stamps. \n \nAs the Road Runner, speed is your ally as you do incredible jumps, burn though loop-de-loops, and avoid all of the Coyote's contraptions and ambushes. The Road Runner can also scare an unsuspecting Coyote with his Beep-Beep attack. \n \nAs the Coyote, you use Acme's crazy gadgets to catch the Road Runner, constantly attempting to master their power without getting yourself flattened. The Coyote has a special leap attack which allows him to make a last ditch attempt to grab the bird!","total_rating":81.4508133591298,"total_rating_count":8,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/desert-demolition-starring-road-runner-and-wile-e-coyote"}
