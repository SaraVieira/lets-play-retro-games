Technosoft acquired a license to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Devil Crash MD (デビルクラッシュＭＤ) and releasing it in Japan. They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragons-fury"}
