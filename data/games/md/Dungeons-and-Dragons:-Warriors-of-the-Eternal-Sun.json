The characters find themselves in a strange, red-hued world in which the horizon slopes upward in all directions, eventually vanishing into a crimson haze at the limits of sight. Their mission is to find and make allies in this new world or else the kingdom and its culture will perish.\n\nThe player leads a party of four characters (either the default party or one that the player has created). Characters and races can be chosen from the normal D&D options. The gameworld is viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters can roam around in realtime. Battles are turn based. Like most role-playing games, the gaming experience focuses on exploration, inventory management and character development.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeons-dragons-warriors-of-the-eternal-sun"}
