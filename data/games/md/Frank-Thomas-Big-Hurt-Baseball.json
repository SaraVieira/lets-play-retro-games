There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points.\n\nYou can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.","total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball"}
