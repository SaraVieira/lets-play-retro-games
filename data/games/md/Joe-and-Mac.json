Whether it was dinosaur demolition or pterodactyl hang-glidin’, life for the boys was pretty cool.\n\nCool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babes. Now the cave-babes are out there - SOMEWHERE, lost and reeeeally lonely… so what are you waitin’ for? It’s up to Joe and Mac to get ‘em back.\n\n* Fight flying pterodactyls in one or two-player simultaneous play.\n* 12 cliff-hangin’ levels with more than 6 bonus levels to find…\n* Amazing arcade graphics will keep you clubbin’ to find your babes…\n* Joe & Mac’s pre-hysterical escapades will keep you comin’ back for more!","total_rating":65.6172924633078,"total_rating_count":24,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/joe-and-mac-caveman-ninja","videos":[{"id":66066,"game":12834,"name":"Zeebo trailer","video_id":"vI9Bjhjn9vY","checksum":"2a7c385b-51b5-4bf1-aef4-d07633d78d43"}]}
