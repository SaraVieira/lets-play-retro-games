Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels were dropped, and the lap-based levels were replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as Out Run), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.\n\nIn addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 also featured the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There was no choice of car however; the player runs with the Elan SE on odd levels, and with the Esprit on even levels.\n\nLotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appear in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music is absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound.\n\nLotus 2 was developed for the Amiga and then converted for the other platforms.","total_rating":80.45816290600561,"total_rating_count":17,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lotus-turbo-challenge-2","videos":[{"id":40611,"game":7659,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"vETonlaTZ4c","checksum":"9d0365ae-3bdc-6e20-3a1b-4c508e13e484"},{"id":40612,"game":7659,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"JLlWlsb9GpQ","checksum":"32ca94f8-a29f-8c9f-0720-f9bf4b48fd6b"}]}
