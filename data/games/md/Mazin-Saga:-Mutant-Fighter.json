Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts.\n\nMazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger.\n\nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.","summary":"A beat em'up/versus fighting game based on the MazinSaga manga by Go Nagai, which was in turn a spin-off of Nagai's original Mazinger Z.","total_rating":77.8416846744972,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mazin-saga-mutant-fighter","videos":[{"id":14269,"game":36947,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"GwM4vzyfmOI","checksum":"661b11d0-0757-baf0-b4d3-9c4e74ad393e"}]}
