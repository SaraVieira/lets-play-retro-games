Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.\n\nA balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.","total_rating":65.5028046376715,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/might-and-magic-ii-gates-to-another-world","videos":[{"id":30617,"game":7734,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"RtcWsqlilr8","checksum":"47d3d32d-7bd0-5756-db7d-b52d7203b204"}]}
