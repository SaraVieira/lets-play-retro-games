Zareth plans to use Alexandra as a sacrifice for the resurrecting of an ancient and evil god known as Zao. Not long after the kidnapping, Zareth's plan becomes apparent as Azuchi castle - the dwelling of Zao - rises from the waters.\n\nJoe Yamato, an experienced sorcerer, is called into action to save Alexandra and stop Zareth's plan to resurrect Zao by battling his way through the dark and bizarre disciples and demons of Zao.","summary":"Mystic Defender is a two-dimensional action video game released for the Sega Genesis system. The players only means of defense in the game is the use of magical spells that the player can acquire during game play (by picking the power up).\n\nPlayers start with a single shooting ball of energy that can be charged to fire one powerful shot, but players can also acquire a spiritual flame that can be pointed in straight and diagonal directions and when charged can reach good distances and a spherical power that launches ricocheting spheres around the screen that multiply when fully charged.\n\nAside from these powers, players can also use a screen-clearing power that summons a three-headed dragon that destroys all enemies and fired shots on screen.\n\nThe game is a port of the Japanese game Kujaku-ou II, removing the anime license.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mystic-defender"}
