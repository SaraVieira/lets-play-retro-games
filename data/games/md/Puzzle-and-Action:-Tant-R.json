It is the first in Puzzle & Action series, and has subsequently been ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear. Though the arcade version of Tant-R reached South Korea, the Mega Drive version remained exclusive to Japan and no versions of the game have ever made it to North America or Europe.\n\nTant-R borrows its graphical style from Bonanza Bros., and is therefore often seen as a spin-off. The two were paired with the game's sequel, Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. Tant-R was also paired with Quiz Shukudai wo Wasuremashita for a compilation on the Sega Saturn. A spinoff Saturn game – Sega Ages Vol.1 Shukudai ga Tant-R – was also made.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-and-action-tant-r","videos":[{"id":48759,"game":46071,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"NMqHy1VxGvQ","checksum":"aaa95900-f422-2119-eb8f-506cd1249bd5"}]}
