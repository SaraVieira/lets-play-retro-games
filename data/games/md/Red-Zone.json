No additional hardware (such as an extra chip in Virtua Racing is used. The game proudly announces this technical achievement before the title screen.\n\nZyrinx were previously responsible for Sub-Terrania, and the two games share similar graphics and logos. The soundtrack was again composed by Jesper Kyd.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/red-zone--1"}
