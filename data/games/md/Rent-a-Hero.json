He received his Combat Armor by accident during their house-warming party, when he ordered pizza from 'Sensational Cafeteria' or SECA and instead received the Rent-A-Hero suit. After realizing the suit gave him incredible strength and that he is required to pay for the armor, Taro decides to become a hero for hire, performing various heroic tasks and odd-jobs for the townspeople of Corja.","summary":"Rent A Hero is an action role-playing video game series released by Sega for the Mega Drive console in 1991 with a large emphasis on humor. The game features the same graphic engine previously used in the development of Sword of Vermilion. However, Rent A Hero has an unusual innovation for the genre. Instead of using standard turn-based battles, fights are in a similar format to 2D fighting games.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rent-a-hero--1","videos":[{"id":47601,"game":145509,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"tcDy7N7PSmk","checksum":"2cbd9dce-89ef-4d61-4726-7562d879c4ce"}]}
