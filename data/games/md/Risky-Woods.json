The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.","total_rating":78.5850843703553,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/risky-woods","videos":[{"id":40473,"game":12205,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"EChseE1P65A","checksum":"b2e6cff9-d91f-de79-9ca1-4f63edc52b63"}]}
