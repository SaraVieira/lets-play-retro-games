As Robocop, you must travel across time into a bloody future ruled by the mechanical forces of Skynet. You'll face attack from every angle, every moment. An unwavering army of Terminators, robotic dogs, spiders, Endoskeletons and a relentless arsenal of automated weapons await you in this veritable hell on earth. To destroy this enemy, free its hostages and finally pierce the dark heart of a killer computer. It will take something more powerful than plasma rifles and laser guns: the human mind that still burns within you.","total_rating":87.26803357337539,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/robocop-versus-the-terminator","videos":[{"id":7719,"game":8195,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"UJu0IeYb7AA","checksum":"504742a1-6b0d-0159-77f2-050d5fbd684a"}]}
