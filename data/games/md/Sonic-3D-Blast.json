He learns that they can travel anywhere using large rings, so he decides to exploit them by turning them into robots to help him search for the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic arrives at the island only to discover the presence of Robotnik, and he is tasked with saving the Flickies and defeating his nemesis.\n\nSonic travels through the island, saving the Flickies and clashing with Robotnik in his various machines. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic proceeds into a black void, where he engages in a final battle with Robotnik, who pilots a large robot. Sonic manages to destroy the robot's weapons and defeats Robotnik, freeing the Flickies. If the player fails to collect the Emeralds, Robotnik escapes in their possession.","summary":"Sonic 3D Blast is a 1996 platform video game developed by Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team, and published by Sega for the Genesis, Saturn, and Windows. Part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game abandons previous Sonic games' side-scrolling style in favor of isometric gameplay, making use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The game features creatures known as Flickies, which first appeared in the 1984 arcade game Flicky. Controlling only Sonic himself, the player's goal is to collect Flickies and carry them to safety, periodically sparring with the series antagonist Dr. Robotnik, who is imprisoning them within robots.","total_rating":61.0776150406986,"total_rating_count":62,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-3d-blast","videos":[{"id":36215,"game":9476,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Q5hnBsUWmAI","checksum":"6e1c6aa1-6934-c3c6-603e-d9f9e6530f83"},{"id":36216,"game":9476,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"VPqPt_R7nuo","checksum":"6d47d1cb-3e78-b390-9529-ed7f8cbf4402"}]}
