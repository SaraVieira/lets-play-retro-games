It was ported internally by Sega of America for the Master System and Game Gear consoles, the latter being published by Acclaim Entertainment through its Flying Edge division. An updated version was also released for the Sega CD under the name of The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin.\n\nAll versions of the video game are side-scrolling platform games, whereby the player controls superhero Spider-Man to battle various supervillains (Doctor Octopus, Sandman, The Lizard, Hobgoblin, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, and Venom) to obtain the keys needed to disarm a nuclear bomb that the Kingpin has not only framed Spider-Man for stealing but plans to detonate within twenty-four hours. In the middle of the game, Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson is also kidnapped by Venom.","total_rating":72.0783141474338,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-amazing-spider-man-vs-the-kingpin"}
