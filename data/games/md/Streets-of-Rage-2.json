Peace has returned to the streets, the once-vacant neighborhoods are being repopulated, and prosperity has returned to the city. Adam has returned to the police force, while Axel and Blaze have moved out of the city and found jobs as a bodyguard and a dance instructor, respectively.\n\nOn the anniversary of their victory over the syndicate, Adam, Axel, and Blaze reunite to celebrate and talk about old times. The next day, however, Axel receives a frantic call from Adam's younger brother, Eddie \"Skate\" Hunter, who returned home from school to find their house completely wrecked. Worse, no one at the police station had seen or heard from Adam since early that morning. Axel and Blaze rush to investigate, and find a photo of Adam, in chains, laying at the feet of a man they know only too well. Mr. X and the Syndicate have returned, and, thirsty for revenge, have kidnapped Adam in the hopes of luring Axel and Blaze into a trap.\n\nAdam's disappearance marked the beginning of a new nightmare. Criminal elements swarmed out to reclaim the streets. Gangs roamed the parks, and bomb-wielding bikers made the roads deadly to travel at night. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than ever before.\n\nAxel and Blaze tried to contact their old friends at the force, the ones who once provided backup with heavy artillery. But everyone they knew had either been fired or transferred elsewhere. This time, the Syndicate was in complete control, and the two ex-cops were on their own.\n\nAssisted by Adam's brother Skate, and Axel's friend Max, Axel and Blaze set out to rescue their friend and destroy Mr. X once and for all. Standing in their way is the nastiest collection of punks and brawlers ever assembled. Add to that a force of professional fighters specially groomed to take them out of the picture!","summary":"Mr. X and the Syndicate are back, this time taking Adam hostage!
