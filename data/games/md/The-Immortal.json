In the first room, the player is given the option of viewing the image of the character's mentor, another wizard named Mordamir. He is calling for help from deep below in the labyrinth, though he is attempting to communicate to another man named Dunric.","summary":"When nightmares come to life... You discover you're not immortal! You're a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal! \n \nThe Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game. \n \nYour old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await. \n \nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.","total_rating":74.9223442995425,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-immortal","videos":[{"id":30403,"game":4444,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"QU9xRamUHAg","checksum":"96be9c0c-e983-6494-e445-44dde063ddd1"},{"id":30404,"game":4444,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"YvVFnGYuv_M","checksum":"80d99d66-0371-6f49-a8b1-1b5168e30529"}]}
