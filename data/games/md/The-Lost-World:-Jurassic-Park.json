The game consists of nineteen missions spread across four sections of the island, referred to as Sites One through Four. Boss levels must be played at the end of each Site in order to advance to the next Site.\n\nA second player, in the role of Ian Malcolm, can help out in Cooperative Mode, or both players can work against each other in Competitive Mode. Weapons such as a taser, tranquilizer gun, shotgun and grenades can be used against hunters and dinosaurs. At times, the player can control vehicles such as an SUV and a hovercraft.","total_rating":60.3884711417372,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-lost-world-jurassic-park","videos":[{"id":41544,"game":8075,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"w14py0kEXK4","checksum":"cc2cd1d1-9360-b58e-f662-5cc40376f49a"},{"id":41545,"game":8075,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"uQF_vJPfDOE","checksum":"e97036b9-1830-ea2d-5c05-fda2677cc55f"}]}
