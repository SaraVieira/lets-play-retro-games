These lights desired domination, and so tried to destroy each other, creating a new darkness and a white light in the process. The white light, desiring peace, locked the other lights and the new darkness in crystals, encased itself in a diamond, and created Alpherion.\n\nApprentice magician Saria is summoned by her teacher to consult a fortuneteller. The fortuneteller alerts Saria to dark wizard Gadou's incoming forces by capturing the great wizards of Alpherion. The fortuneteller gives Saria items so she can go and defeat Gadou.","summary":"Twinkle Tale is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up developed by Studio Ducks and published by Wonder Amusement Studio exclusively in Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/twinkle-tale","videos":[{"id":73248,"game":46179,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"f55z988wECc","checksum":"19e04d0f-a2e7-5fa5-1a56-100d2cdac510"}]}
