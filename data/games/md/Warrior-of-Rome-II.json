The player controls a number of individual units in each map, which can be directed in various ways, such as to approach and attack a particular target, construct or demolish structures, or form or disband units.\n\nThe single-player scenario begins with Caesar receiving orders from Rome to suppress a revolt in Asia. There is also a free battle mode for one or two players that features several dozen maps to choose from. A unique feature of the game is the highly configurable menu system. The player can move, resize, rearrange, and close any of the different information windows as they see fit.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/warrior-of-rome-ii"}
