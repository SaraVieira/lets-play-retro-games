It is the first game in the series and was originally released in 1994. A Sega CD version was planned, but later cancelled.\n\nThe game was a major advancement in Sega baseball games in that it included licensed MLB players and teams (the first baseball video game to have both such licenses [previous baseball video games only had one license]; they are based on the rosters for the 1994 MLB season), and relatively accurate gameplay.\n\nSan Diego Padres broadcaster Jerry Coleman provides the play-by-play for the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/world-series-baseball--3","videos":[{"id":54980,"game":171986,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"UsmbxubXfJg","checksum":"e8ea931b-9441-6b0b-3197-666f077c95a0"}]}
