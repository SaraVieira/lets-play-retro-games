It was meant to be a sequel to Zero Tolerance, but it was never finished.\n\nA prototype of Beyond Zero Tolerance (labeled \"Build: 062395a\", suggesting a build date of 23 June 1995) was released as freeware by its creator (as was Zero Tolerance). Like it's predecessor, Beyeond Zero Tolerance was designed with the Link-up cable in mind for it's cooperative mode. It is mostly the same game as Zero Tolerance bar new graphics, and is far from being complete. All of the music in the prototype is recycled from the first game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/beyond-zero-tolerance"}
