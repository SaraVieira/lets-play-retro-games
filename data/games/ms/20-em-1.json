The games included in the collection were made for children and are relatively basic, ranging from driving to platformers to shoot-'em-ups. None of the terrible games have been named, being only identified by numbers.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/20-em-1","videos":[{"id":49423,"game":94700,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"HkCNiWcU2KA","checksum":"09b51d64-4cc9-d496-b86e-c403e27657d5"},{"id":51640,"game":94700,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"zQ0cXGTmL3g","checksum":"170559b7-a321-2f40-3929-a6e2e3ae0a91"}]}
