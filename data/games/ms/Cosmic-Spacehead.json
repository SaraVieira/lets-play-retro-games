After returning home and expecting a hero's welcome, Linus soon found his fellow Linomen were skeptical of the existence of the so-called \"planet Earth\" and decides to return to it, this time with a camera. However, he has no money (Linoleum currency is the Linobuck), and must adventure around the planet to acquire a vehicle and a camera. In his adventures, Linus leaves Linoleum (using a fake ID for Larry Flynt to compete in a bumper car contest), quashes a robot revolution in Detroitica and gets gas from an abandoned space station.","summary":"Cosmic needs your help! He has no money, no car, and no respect from his fellow Cosmonaut's!

Starting from his home town Old Lino Town, it's Cosmic gameplay all the way in a unique blend of adventure and arcade action plus a whole galaxy of surprises thrown in!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cosmic-spacehead","videos":[{"id":53443,"game":12013,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"IFf9Xgcu0N8","checksum":"b77f1cc7-97e4-89b7-f371-c5de0598730f"}]}
