The game's plot was felt by commentators to be a thinly disguised reference to the Gulf War, while comparisons were drawn between Kilbaba and Saddam Hussein, and between the game's unnamed desert setting and Iraq","summary":"Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf, commonly known as Desert Strike, is a shoot 'em up video game released by Electronic Arts (EA) in February 1992 for Sega's Mega Drive. The game was later released on several other formats such as the SNES, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a lone Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.","total_rating":82.2507802033377,"total_rating_count":37,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/desert-strike-return-to-the-gulf","videos":[{"id":2438,"game":6798,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"RYVDt8XhTBM","checksum":"8520c6a8-9f37-311d-834f-afa08ab76ec2"}]}
