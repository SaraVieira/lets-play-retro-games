There are 15 stages to complete, which takes the player through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, and boat docks. There are bosses on some stages. During each stage, the player picks up ammunition with varying amounts. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, there may be 60 bullets.\n\nBosses attack in several ways. Note that the bosses are not just people. The player also battles an ape, a tiger, a monster truck in \"Eagles Stadium\", and cyborgs. Once these first three bosses are defeated, the player's rank rises to captain, followed by assistant chief, and finally to chief.\n\nOnce the chief rank has been achieved, the player is given a cyber suit, which is described by the game as a \"long-range supersonic powered suit\" which contains two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, and provides extra ammunition and protection. This suit is used for the rest of the game. At this point, the player will have to arrest criminal masterminds.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/e-swat-cyber-police"}
