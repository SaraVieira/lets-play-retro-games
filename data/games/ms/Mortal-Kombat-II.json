He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and restores Tsung's youth. He extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The tournament is dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will unbalance the furies and allow Outworld to subsume Earthrealm.","summary":"The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.","total_rating":75.7197826992374,"total_rating_count":221,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-ii","videos":[{"id":34306,"game":1619,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"oYoU61lJ35s","checksum":"84f24ea0-6a04-595b-edcf-91dc90f7d776"}]}
