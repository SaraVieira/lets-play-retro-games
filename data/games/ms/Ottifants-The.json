The name is a portmanteau of Waalkes' nickname Otti and the German word for elephant. \n \nGame description: \n \n \"All is not well for Bruno, the baby Ottifant. A father captured by Aliens! Or so our Otti-infant imagines as he follows the trail of sweets that will lead him to his abducted parent. It's a trail of peril and adventure--- terrifying toys, a blood-chilling basement and an office of hi-tech horror.\"","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ottifants"}
