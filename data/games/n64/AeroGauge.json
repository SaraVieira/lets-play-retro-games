Play solo through the grand prix and compete against the AI enemy, or beat down your best time in the time trial mode.\n\nEach track features a number of twists and turns, whether it be racing upside down or vertically, with a number of obstacles in your path. There's no weapons, though, it's just you and the open road ahead.","total_rating":68.3893806559244,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aerogauge","videos":[{"id":62681,"game":3329,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"42HDgCgdf6c","checksum":"006b0203-a294-4b46-d724-64c009767784"}]}
