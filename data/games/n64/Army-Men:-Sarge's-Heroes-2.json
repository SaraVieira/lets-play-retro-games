It is announced that the capture of Field Marshal Tannenberg will end the war. Since General Plastro has disappeared, it is suggested that he has become a victim of plastrification and been trapped in the real world. The game introduces Bridgette Bleu, a spy for the Blue Nation. She has developed a serum that reverses plastrification. Your job as Sarge and sometimes Vikki is to destroy the serum, eliminate Tan soldiers, and capture Plastro and Tannenburg.","total_rating":72.98091748984591,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/army-men-sarge-s-heroes-2","videos":[{"id":62691,"game":3441,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"X0zDh5dI7J8","checksum":"c45b5d91-8007-59a2-116d-7a5c251b35f7"}]}
