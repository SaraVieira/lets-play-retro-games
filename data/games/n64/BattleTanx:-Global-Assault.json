Griffin and his army manage to push back the invaders, but Cassandra soon turns the tables by mind-controlling Griffin's own army. Griffin and Madison manage to escape San Francisco and begin chasing Cassandra across the United States, eventually cornering her in Washington, D.C.. Cassandra, however, escapes with Brandon to Great Britain; Griffin and Madison follow. They build a new army in Europe, and chase Cassandra through England, France and Germany. While in Paris, they discover Cassandra released the virus in 2001 to kill every female on Earth who didn't have the power of the Edge.","summary":"Global Assault is the sequel to the original BattleTanx. It features many new weapons, new vehicles, and new powers that were not available in the original. Global Assault now also features a destructible environment, allowing you to seize control of the environment and create ultimate destruction. Global Assault allows two players to play together in co-operative mode, or four players to go head-to-head as one of the dozens of tank gangs in all new maps and many more game modes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battletanx-global-assault"}
