As the title implies, Cruis'n World allows players to race on various tracks around the world. The game also features more cars than Cruis'n USA. This game introduced stunts to the Cruis'n series. They served to dodge obstacles, take close curves and so. If the stunt makes the vehicle fly in the air, the game gives the player extra seconds of time. The game also uses small rocket boosts to speed up. The game was later released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, being the best received of the Cruis'n ports.","total_rating":76.5562587551085,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cruis-n-world","videos":[{"id":38557,"game":3430,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"QI4bx1Djxes","checksum":"bc50eda8-7929-7fe2-4c2d-0ce0a87c6a45"}]}
