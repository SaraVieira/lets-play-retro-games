It was released only in Japan in 1998. The game's editor allows players to design their own shooting game levels similar to the levels shown in Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth. The game has a large number of options, from creating the stage boss or adding a custom soundtrack for each level. It was originally developed alongside an ultimately unreleased accompanying expansion disk title for 64DD.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dezaemon-3d","videos":[{"id":60045,"game":3470,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"nlMjfTAevBg","checksum":"96713556-2043-a0b4-ac2f-0474bb7748e3"}]}
