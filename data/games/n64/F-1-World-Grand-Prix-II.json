The game has 4 modes of play: the championship season mode, the exhibition race, time trials, and the challenge mode. R and Z are used to shift gears, the analog stick is used to steer the car, A is the accelerator and B is the brake. The C-buttons allow for camera changes and backmirror views. It's pretty much the same setup and how these work are pretty much unchanged from the first game to the second.","total_rating":70.1454278168153,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f-1-world-grand-prix-ii"}
