You can choose from 150 national and club teams and develop your tactics and strategies in a friendly match. And when the time comes, try to win a Tournament. If you like something more substantial than tournament play, try to win a Season and become a league champion, or skip straight to the Playoffs. Should a friend want to join the action, he can with the Two-Player mode. In all of the game modes, you can play with free-and-loose Arcade rules, or strict referees and penalties in Simulation. Thanks to the motion-captured animation, you'll get smooth and realistic player movement, which helps put you in the middle of the action.
