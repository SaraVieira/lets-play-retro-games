He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure. Each level parodies a certain aspect of television culture (here the levels exist as stand-alone channels). Gex enters each level through a television set. He must collect remote controls to advance to the next level in order to complete his mission and rescue Xtra.\n\nThis N64 port removes some suggestive content.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gex-3-deep-cover-gecko--1"}
