Two years later, his quiet life is soon turned upside down when one day he was watching television when all of a sudden, it goes blank and Rez's image begins flashing on the screen. Two government agents appear and abduct Gex to their headquarters, in which Gex is interrogated. The agents explain that Rez has returned and they need his help in taking him down again. Gex refuses, saying that he has already saved the world once and that they should try to find someone else. When the agents make a fair negotiation for a huge sum of cash and gadgets, Gex tells them everything. He accepts the mission, to which he leaves the building and is then accosted by a female agent who introduces herself as Agent Xtra and wishes him good luck.\n\nAfter navigating numerous television channels in the Media Dimension, Gex finally confronts Rez and the two battle once again until Gex drops a huge television set on Rez severely weakening him. In desperation, Rez tells Gex through a television that he is his father. Gex merely turns the television off; whether or not he believes Rez is unknown. In the final scene, Gex shares a hotel room with Nikki from the Pandemonium series.","summary":"Gex 64 was the Nintendo 64 port of Gex: Enter the Gecko.\n\nThis version featured a new level, which replaced the secret levels. \"Gecques Cousteau\", which is centered on the RMS Titanic, is played almost entirely underwater. The only land parts of the level are at the entrance to the Titanic, which is sunk by the iceberg.\n\nOther changes include fewer bonus levels and fewer quotes, due to the Nintendo 64 cartridges storing significantly less data for games than CDs. Some of the sound effects were altered slightly.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gex-64-enter-the-gecko","videos":[{"id":49170,"game":47758,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"V4fe7RvU5Lo","checksum":"91b8de13-692e-79fb-3696-70d8348ddfdf"}]}
