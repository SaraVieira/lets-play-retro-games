Have you ever wanted to control your very own Pokémon? Now you can with HEY YOU, PIKACHU! for the Nintendo 64. It's as simple as speaking into the microphone that connects to your controller.

Wake up Pikachu each day by shouting \"Good Morning!\" and decide what games to play and activities to engage in. You can play Pokémon trivia on the in-game TV, gather food, hunt for treasure, collect seemingly endless goodies, go fishing, baby-sit Caterpie, and much more.
