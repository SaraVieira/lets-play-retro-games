The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mrc-multi-racing-championship"}
