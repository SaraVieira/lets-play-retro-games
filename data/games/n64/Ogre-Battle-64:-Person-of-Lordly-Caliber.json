There he witnesses the plight of the lower classes – the victims of a tyrannical ruling elite whose only thought is for the preservation of their own lofty status. With civil war brewing, Magnus is faced with a terrible choice: to betray his own noble origins in the name of liberty, or turn a blind eye to the evils of his rotten society.\"","total_rating":96.88514085375671,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ogre-battle-64-person-of-lordly-caliber"}
