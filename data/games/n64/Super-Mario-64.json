I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly, Princess Toadstool.”\n\n“Wow, an invitation from Peach! I'll head out right away. I hope she can wait for me!”\n\nMario is so excited to receive the invitation from the princess, who lives in the Mushroom Castle that he quickly dresses in his best and leaves right away.\n\n“Hmmm, something's not quite right here... It's so quiet...”\n\nShaking off his uneasy premonition, Mario steps into the silent castle, where he is greeted by the gruff words, “No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha.”\n\nThe sound seems to come from everywhere.\n\n“Who's there?! I've heard that voice somewhere before...”\n\nMario begins searching all over the castle. Most of the doors are locked, but finding one open, he peeks inside. Hanging on the wall is the largest painting he has ever seen, and from behind the painting comes the strangest sound that he has ever heard...\n\n“I think I hear someone calling. What secrets does this painting hold?”\n\nWithout a second thought, Mario jumps at the painting. As he is drawn into it, another world opens before his very eyes.\n\nOnce inside the painting, Mario finds himself in the midst of battling Bob-ombs. According to the Bob-omb Buddies, someone...or something...has suddenly attacked the castle and stolen the “Power Stars.” These stars protect the castle. With the stars in his control, the beast plans to take over the Mushroom Castle.\n\nTo help him accomplish this, he plans to convert the residents of the painting world into monsters as well. If nothing is done, all those monsters will soon begin to overflow from inside the painting.\n\n“A plan this maniacal, this cunning...this must be the work of Bowser!”\n\nPrincess Toadstool and Toad are missing, too. Bowser must have taken them and sealed them inside the painting. Unless Mario recovers the Power Stars immediately, the inhabitants of this world will become Bowser's army.\n\n“Well, Bowser's not going to get away with it, not as long as I'm around!”\n\nStolen Power Stars are hidden throughout the painting world. Use your wisdom and strength to recover the Power Stars and restore peace to the Mushroom Castle.\n\n“Mario! You are the only one we can count on.”","summary":"This version of Super Mario 64, originally released only in Japan, under the title Super Mario 64 Shindou Pak Taiou Version, is an enhancement over the International release of the game, as it retains all of the glitch fixes as well as graphical and sound changes. The main differences of this version are the Rumble Pak support, some small glitch fixes, the most notorious being the removal of the backwards long jump, a very important technique for the speedrunning scene, and a new title screen easter egg. This version would later be released on the iQue Player in China (without Rumble support), on the Japanese Wii and Wii U Virtual Console. It was finally localized and released internationally as part of Super Mario 3D All-Stars (under the name of \"Super Mario 64\"), with small visual enhancements.","total_rating":79.97020426377449,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-64--1","videos":[{"id":60107,"game":132642,"name":"TV commercial","video_id":"q50kEAnHrbo","checksum":"fc5ef88e-e3f5-9774-a5eb-60be541a8c76"},{"id":60108,"game":132642,"name":"TV commercial","video_id":"ENZ9Aqr2gPs","checksum":"a7003e7c-b71e-2d82-9c1b-15048cb2f73e"},{"id":60109,"game":132642,"name":"TV commercial","video_id":"D1Xq5k3Q6GE","checksum":"cc3a0177-5def-9407-5296-958ee6bc2aaf"},{"id":60110,"game":132642,"name":"TV commercial","video_id":"hyim9Ym_zy8","checksum":"a5a3c119-4f1b-f1fa-5edd-7da60b871f41"},{"id":60111,"game":132642,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"TfsXx11RqL4","checksum":"bc470622-5423-aabe-8152-12aacc971b02"}]}
