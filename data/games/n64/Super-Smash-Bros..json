Players must defeat their opponents multiple times in a fighting frenzy of items and power-ups. Super Smash Bros. is a departure from the general genre of fighting games: instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, the players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken.","total_rating":82.98869484179535,"total_rating_count":306,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-smash-bros","videos":[{"id":35902,"game":1626,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"vX9w2M-6bx0","checksum":"c65786c6-22cc-65b2-918a-a4b43cce5916"},{"id":60119,"game":1626,"name":"TV commercial (USA)","video_id":"K783SDTBKmg","checksum":"54c47ecc-175a-f117-feef-6edc47361fd4"},{"id":60120,"game":1626,"name":"TV commercials","video_id":"F_PFsAQVa4U","checksum":"1f5ff8ff-bddd-c64b-7dea-ed273c8444c4"}]}
