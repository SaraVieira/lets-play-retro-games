It featured high-scoring games and over-the-top fights. There was also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others.","total_rating":71,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wayne-gretzky-s-3d-hockey"}
