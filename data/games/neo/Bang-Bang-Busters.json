It's play mechanics are similar to that of Mario Brothers, Snow Brothers, and similar style games. The two characters can actually \"blow up\" enemies by puffing them as is done in Dig Dug, and even toss them onto other enemies for chain points. It also contains special bonuses and many stage bosses. \nIt was rumored that the game was undergoing re-consideration for release in 2000. About a year later, Zupapa by FACE, also from 1994, made it to market instead in 2001. This is why there are two known versions of the game. The 1994 original & the 2000 revision. The game also goes by the names \"Bang Busters\" and \"Bang 2 Busters\" by some sources.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bang-bang-busters","videos":[{"id":29790,"game":40189,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"_wtgzlSWm0k","checksum":"5771de30-77ed-a942-a474-e22fa7ee7f76"}]}
