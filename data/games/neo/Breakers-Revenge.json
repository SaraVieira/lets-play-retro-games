It introduces one new character named Saizo and makes the final boss Bai-Hu into a playable character. Revenge makes adjustment to the character balance by weakening the previously overpowered Condor and removing Sho's infinite combo from the first game. However, the opening intro is almost identical to that of the first game and game's graphics are not that different; however, the lifebars were modified to look different compared to the first game's lifebars, while some stages' graphics were removed (e.g. flags in Sho Kamui's stage).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/breakers-revenge"}
