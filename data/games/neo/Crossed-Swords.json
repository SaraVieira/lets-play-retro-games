Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.[1]\n\nThe game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person[1] or third-person.[3] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator.[4] A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.[5]","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crossed-swords"}
