Unique features in the game includes destructible environments and a super move meter which fills out based on how much energy the player has left, giving weaker fighters a handicap. After defeating the default 10 fighters, the player faces Shuko's bodyguard, Duke, before fighting Shuko himself.","total_rating":52.5892406422191,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon--2","videos":[{"id":40529,"game":138806,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"dCXuzqlCyCQ","checksum":"e0882783-f60b-8f64-89dd-4bd1cac09636"}]}
