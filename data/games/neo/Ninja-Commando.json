The players can choose between three ninja characters, all with differing abilities. Each of them has fighting game-style[1] input commands that unleash their scroll-based ninpo special moves. As usual in the genre, the game's stages end with boss battles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-commando"}
