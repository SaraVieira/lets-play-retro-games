The story behind it is that in every 1000 years there is a Tournament held by the animal gods Pochi (the Dog) and Nyaa (the Cat) in decision who will be the top star for the next millennium, although they need the power of Earth's people to do so. The gameplay is similar to Super Puzzle Fighter and Puyo Pop, but with a few differences.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pochi-and-nyaa"}
