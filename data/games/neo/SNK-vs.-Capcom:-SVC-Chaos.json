Unlike its predecessor, Capcom vs. SNK 2, this game lacks both air guards and a \"groove system\", instead focusing on quicker gameplay. Characters are provided with a basic 3-level bar system for executing super-special attacks with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (for example, the player cannot increase the damage of the Zujou Sashi used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons anymore).","total_rating":69.0795230638462,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-svc-chaos","videos":[{"id":21648,"game":6184,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"bQnd4Cw4oMU","checksum":"c01d044b-4ebf-a1e6-df71-d5d341771f14"}]}
