It features 12 teams divided into two groups which compete for the \"SNK Cup\" (the main differences between teams is their formations on the field):\n\nGroup A: Germany, Italy, Spain, England, Mexico, Japan\nGroup B: Argentina, Holland, Brazil, France, United States, South Korea\n\nThe players' team plays against all the others in their group, then it goes into an elimination tournament's semifinals and then the final to win the cup. There was also a hidden feature in the game, which wasn't documented, and affects a single player game. During a free kick for the CPU if the player has tapped button A for player two, the CPU performs a short-shot, while pressing the button A performs a longer kick.","total_rating":69.9618868186589,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-sidekicks","videos":[{"id":15119,"game":52191,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"1QKB5vnFDXs","checksum":"54779a1a-0bc0-4309-3609-f80aecac6a67"}]}
