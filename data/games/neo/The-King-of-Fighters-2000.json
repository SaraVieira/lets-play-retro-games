A fellow commander and long-time friend of Heidern, named Ling, tells the veteran fighter that Kâ€² and Maxima were once operatives of Nests and that they may hold the key to locating the whereabouts of the mysterious organization. Using this information, Heidern decides to focus his efforts in using the next KOF tournament as a way to lure both K' and Maxima out so that they can be captured and interrogated into telling the authorities about the Nests cartel. Unknown to Heidern, however, Ling has his own agenda.","summary":"The King of Fighters 2000 features an improved Striker call system with the Active Striker System, which allows the player to call his Striker character in any situation, whether he is attacking or being attacked by the opponent, allowing him to use their strikers in combos.
