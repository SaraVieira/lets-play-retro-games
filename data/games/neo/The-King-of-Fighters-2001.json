There's no guarantee that even with this tournament, tragedy will not repeat itself....\n\nThe third title in the King of Fighters: The NESTS Chronicles. At last, this tournament will end it all!\"\n\nThe NESTS cartel decides to host the 2001 KOF tournament so that they can use it as a method to eliminate their enemies and enter their own team into the ranks.\n\nIn the tournament finals, the Hero Team boards a special blimp that is soon revealed to be a spaceship. There they meet Original Zero, whose clone decimated the cartels' secrecy with his scheme in the previous year. He congratulates them for reaching the finals and states that they're headed for NESTS's real headquarters. He decides to entertain his passengers with a match and is backed up by his pet black lion Glugan, Ron, and Krizalid. Despite the oppressive force of his group, he is defeated moments before the ship docks at NESTS's space satellite. He stays on board the exploding ship and urges the Hero team to proceed forward.\n\nOnce inside NESTS's satellite, they face the NESTS leader, Nests. He expresses wishes for his renegade agents to return to the organization and is soon afterward killed by Igniz, who claims ownership of the cartel. Igniz also reveals that K', Kula, Krizalid, K9999 and Whip are guinea pigs/creations made for his own personal entertainment. Kula, who was separated from the rest of her team and present at the time, also heard her origin as an artificial life form. Declaring himself a god, he assaults the team as his first act of \"divine retribution\" and defeats them. As soon as he's about to kill K', other fighters came to intervene and help in the fight including all team leaders, Kyo and Iori. When he's defeated, he proclaims that he is fallen god and names himself a \"demon\" instead. He plunges the satellite through earth's atmosphere in an attempt to demolish his competition.\n\nThankfully, the satellite crashes into the ocean and the fighters aboard were somehow saved from the explosion, presumably thanks to Ron. K' saves Kula from drowning; in gratitude, she and her guardian, Diana, ally themselves with K' and company. K9999 and Angel are presumably still alive though their exact whereabouts are unknown. Foxy is also stabbed by them though her apparent on screen death is later revealed to be false.","summary":"The King of Fighters 2001 is the eighth game in The King of Fighters series, the third and final part of the \"Nests Chronicles\" story arc, and the first game produced following the closure of the original SNK.\nKOF 2001 kept the Striker assist system from the previous two KOF games, but added a new twist to it - the ability to adjust how many Strikers a team could have. While teams in 1999 and 2000 were limited to selecting one teammate as an assist, now teams could have up to 3 assist characters, or none at all.","total_rating":76.70986498752964,"total_rating_count":29,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-2001","videos":[{"id":21718,"game":15432,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"-2TcH2ismsY","checksum":"b2cd58f0-095d-5044-7955-833fec423d59"}]}
