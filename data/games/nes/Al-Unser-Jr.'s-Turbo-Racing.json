The season comprises a fairly typical formula one season. Al Unser Jr. was a prominent American race car driver who has won the Indianapolis 500 twice. Interestingly, he never raced in Formula One.","summary":"Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing is a racing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System console released in 1990. It is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese-market Famicom game World Grand Prix - Pole to Finish, with the most notable changes being the addition of Unser as an in-game coach, the number of laps, sound and interface design. This game features a season mode and two time trial modes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/al-unser-jr-dot-s-turbo-racing","videos":[{"id":3456,"game":8809,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"RDzpkGFm7-Y","checksum":"a8cd97a4-c900-f88c-3b0c-77cf7aad3da5"}]}
