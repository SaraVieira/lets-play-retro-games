The player must guide Amagon through the island to reach the rescue ship, defeating a number of foes-including the final boss, which is based on the \"Flatwoods Monster\", a rumoured space alien residing in Flatwoods, West Virginia.\nThe original Japanese version departs from the above in that the main character is not a marine, but is instead a scientist named \"Jackson\" who transforms himself into his Macho-Man form using a special drug.","summary":"Amagon is a Nintendo Entertainment System platform side-scroller developed by Aicom in 1988. It was subject to a high level of criticism, and never reached a high level of recognition among game critics.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/amagon","videos":[{"id":3472,"game":8916,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"t8GkpRdg8S4","checksum":"9c9095f0-1ade-35a4-be3b-1e49826c8fee"}]}
