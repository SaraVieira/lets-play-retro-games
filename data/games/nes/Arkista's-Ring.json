The only hope for the Elves is that the strong warrior Christine, equipped with only a bow, can travel throughout the Kingdom, and retrieve the ring.","summary":"Arkista's Ring is a game developed by American Sammy for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. It utilizes the familiar top-down perspective featured in many action-adventure games, such as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Shining Force. What sets it apart is the linear style of the game, as well as the limitation of one primary character. Interestingly, Arkista's Ring is an example of an early game with a female protagonist-an elf named Christine. The game is now considered to be a particularly rare NES title.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arkistas-ring","videos":[{"id":3497,"game":9024,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"P7qjA56StVM","checksum":"48755628-76d5-9fd6-506e-fb263d447bcc"}]}
