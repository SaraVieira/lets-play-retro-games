The teams in the game are based off of the 1991 AFL season, in addition to the fictional teams Darwin, Canberra, and Hobart. Season play was not available-players were limited to playing individual games at a time.","summary":"Aussie Rules Footy was developed by Beam Software as the first Australian Football League simulation game for the NES. It was exclusively released in Australia, and was never released anywhere else in the world. The game allowed for one player and two player in versus.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aussie-rules-footy"}
