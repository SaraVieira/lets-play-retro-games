game starts in New York City, where President Ronnie (based on former U.S. President Ronald Reagan) has been kidnapped by the nefarious DragonNinja. The intro says: \"Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...\". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent (who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appears in The Terminator) asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: \"President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?\", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different. After they heard that, the Bad Dudes confirmed it by pursuing the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base, in order to save President Ronnie.","summary":"Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja, often referred to simply as Bad Dudes (on the American NES port of the arcade original), and known in Japan simply as DragonNinja is a 1988 arcade game developed and published by Data East. It was also ported to many computer and game console home systems.\n\nBad Dudes is a side-scrolling beat 'em up where the players are set in the role of the titular duo tasked with rescuing \"President Ronnie\" from ninja kidnappers. It was met with commercial success, and a generally positive to mixed critical reception. It has since become widely known for its general premise and introductory cut scene.","total_rating":69.73326373617991,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bad-dudes","videos":[{"id":46741,"game":18831,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"i6Ur2yVfBww","checksum":"a00e7b76-1d08-0132-ebcf-ed4c35371f3d"},{"id":54594,"game":18831,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pvNx6SFl9bA","checksum":"f2d4fbb4-2d7f-c6d2-0311-48700ce35064"}]}
