The object is to score the most runs. There are six different teams available in the different versions of the game. For the Famicon players, the teams represent members of the Japanese Central League, and the NES version includes members of Major League Baseball. There are, however, no significant differences between the different teams aside from uniform colour.","summary":"The simply titled game \"Baseball\" was developed by Nintendo in 1983 for the Nintendo Family Computer, and was one of the very first games released for the Famicon. It was also included as one of the 18 games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System's original launch in the United States.","total_rating":59.9865924912747,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baseball","videos":[{"id":3959,"game":7580,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"3RxgAJ4qtgY","checksum":"49a902a0-6f92-e745-4a34-9dea31781e8e"}]}
