The game's primary objective was to play a \"perfect game\", rather than winning the pennant-which had been the focus of the previous games in the series.","summary":"Bases Loaded 3 is the third entry in the Bases Loaded series published by Jaleco for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in 1990 in Japan, and 1991 in North America and was exclusively on the NES. The game departed from the two previous installments by removing seasonal play, focusing instead simply on individual exhibition games. It was noteworthy due to the endorsement of Ryne Sandberg, the famed baseball player.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bases-loaded-3","videos":[{"id":4061,"game":10124,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"sfumppUWRVk","checksum":"fc9817ad-b004-6067-3cb4-bb427ad3f5fc"}]}
