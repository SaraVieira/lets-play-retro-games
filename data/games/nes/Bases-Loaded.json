This allowed the player a more realistic feel, and made Bases Loaded into one of the most popular baseball games for early NES.\nThe league was made of fictitious teams, as it was difficult to achieve a license from the MBA, and included 12 American cities with unique players on each team. One unique feature that the game included was that each team had one batter who would charge the mound when provoked by the pitcher.","summary":"Bases Loaded is a baseball game that was released for Arcade and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. It was developed by Jaleco and TOSE, and was the first installment in the Bases Loaded series, which was followed by seven sequels for three generations of consoles. The game tried to focus on the confrontation between the pitcher and the batter, putting emphasis on the face-off between the two. Unfortunately, this made the perspective fairly limited in determining where to hit the ball, or even where the ball was during a pitch.","total_rating":79.3595791094554,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bases-loaded","videos":[{"id":4026,"game":7764,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"ygofWR2A3ZA","checksum":"1f5c4039-a17a-0696-de57-11ab6f6fa3b4"}]}
