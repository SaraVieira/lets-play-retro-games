It's inspired by games like Gradius and Parodius. The settlers have been exploiting Irataâ€™s natural resources for many solar cycles. The Wampus took back the mountains. The Wart Worms took back the mines. But now Lizzy the Bat Lizard must embark on a quest to end the Settler scourge once and for all, dauntless in the wind with the echoes of her ancestors at her back.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bat-lizard-bonanza","videos":[{"id":62796,"game":186176,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Uq0ZhI6Xh-A","checksum":"cd223cd0-96fc-4750-6929-fcf45bdbe782"}]}
