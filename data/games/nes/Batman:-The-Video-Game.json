Despite having the same title, each is actually a different game. The NES title is arguably the best known and contains five levels culminating in a final showdown with the Joker in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well despite changes from the movie upon which it was based.\n\nSunsoft later released Batman: Return of the Joker as a follow-up which is not related to any movie.","total_rating":73.18831456298321,"total_rating_count":21,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-the-video-game--2"}
