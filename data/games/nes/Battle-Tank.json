The player, after receiving mission orders for each level, must travel to an objective and fight various enemies-including other tanks, helicopters, and infantry.","summary":"Battle Tank was developed by Imagineering in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and eventually ported to the Sega Game Gear console. It was originally set to become a space flight game for the Commodore 64, and thus was underdeveloped for what it became.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-tank","videos":[{"id":4257,"game":10623,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"lVY-CYWL0g4","checksum":"effe1be9-01db-0d52-b9c4-93f08842a890"}]}
