The protagonist is a soldier with a bionic arm that extends and contracts. His arm allows him to grab on to fixed objects to swing around and climb up platforms, which is the only way to do so due to the lack of a jumping ability. The arm also grabs opponents and pulls them towards the player character.","total_rating":65.2593439779747,"total_rating_count":17,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bionic-commando--3"}
