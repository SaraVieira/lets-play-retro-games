The only way to put the itch at ease is by collecting some games, and what better way to do that than by hitting the streets right around the area you live?! You'll talk to people to get tips on where to find games, or perform specific tasks for them to get a prize straight from them! But beware, there are those that don't care for nasty collectors, and will do anything to try and stop you!","summary":"A meta NES RPG where you play as an aspiring retro game collector trying to collect all black box NES games. With every game you collect you get to play a mini-game version of the title to earn power-ups to help out with the main game. \n \nA version of the game was also released to promote release of Jeffrey Wittenhagen's book \"Twisted Realities: Black Box Challenge\" under the name \"Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge\". Though the only difference to the game is the title screen.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/black-box-challenge","videos":[{"id":43975,"game":108811,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"rGzXu_Ejg_c","checksum":"a88f129b-efc1-5789-2994-531005d3c19c"}]}
