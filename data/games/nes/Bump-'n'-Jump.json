The arcade version was available as both a dedicated board and as part of Data East's DECO Cassette System. It was distributed in North America by Bally Midway. The goal is to drive to the end of a level while bumping enemy vehicles into the sides of the track and jumping over large obstacles such as bodies of water.\n\nThe arcade game was a commercial success in Japan and North America. The game was ported to the Atari 2600, Intellivision, ColecoVision, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Sharp X1. The Famicom version of Burnin' Rubber was published as \"Buggy Popper\" in Japan in 1986.","total_rating":66.7020315036574,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bump-n-jump","videos":[{"id":55135,"game":5664,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"4yzf_Q8xF1A","checksum":"99846d3c-5b29-2930-38e2-a36acdfbd886"},{"id":55136,"game":5664,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"IAPXIJhyevM","checksum":"458eb2c1-1936-5ff0-f1dd-b702f2f13bc1"}]}
