Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.\n\nYou make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.\n\nThe game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.\n\nTowers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.","total_rating":45,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/castelian","videos":[{"id":55540,"game":85025,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"ZXVy6XumttI","checksum":"8b651c91-4c37-95d3-ac4e-d67a11024358"}]}
