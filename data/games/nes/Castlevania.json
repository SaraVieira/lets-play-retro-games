You've arrived at Castlevania, and you're here on business: To destroy forever the Curse of the Evil Count.\n\nUnfortunately, everybody's home this evening. Bats, ghosts, every kind of creature you can imagine. You'll find 'em all over the place, if they don't find you first. Because you've got to get through six monstrous floors before you even meet up with the Master of the House. Your Magic Whip will help, and you'll probably find a weapons or two along the way. But once you make it to the tower, you can count on a Duel to the Death. The Count has waited 100 years for a rematch.","total_rating":78.53995663836871,"total_rating_count":240,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/castlevania","videos":[{"id":23251,"game":1114,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"D-3UdDRG7io","checksum":"e19eff1a-0169-9f58-bdbf-b441cc32ef16"}]}
