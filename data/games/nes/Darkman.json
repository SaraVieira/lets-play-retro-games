DARKMAN now lives. Now you take on the role of Darkman - master the technology of his disguising system - enter the gang of mobster Robert G. Durant and conquer them from within. Live through all the high spots of the movie - the breathtaking helicopter flight sequence - the skyscraper shoot-out - dice with death as you are plunged, swinging into the heaving freeway traffic. DARKMAN lives... but not for long?!","summary":"The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name. In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses.","total_rating":53,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/darkman"}
