Rock, as he spelunks various caves and catacombs whilst searching for the mythical Lost City.\n\nThe game was the first game to be developed by the newly re-branded Rare, whereas the first game to be released under the company was Solar Jetman, earlier in 1990. Digger T. Rock is also the first Rare game released for a Nintendo console. \n\nIt was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/digger-t-rock-the-legend-of-the-lost-city"}
