The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dirty-harry"}
