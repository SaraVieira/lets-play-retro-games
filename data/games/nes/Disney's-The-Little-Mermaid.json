So Ariel (After explaining what's going on to Eric) becomes a mermaid once more and sets off to rescue the sea.\n\nThe game takes place from a side view and Ariel (Swimming most of the time, but hopping around on the land occasionally) can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and can then throw them at each other. She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.","total_rating":69.6633174662633,"total_rating_count":19,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-the-little-mermaid--1","videos":[{"id":47255,"game":19900,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"9tFfxahz9L8","checksum":"e989c636-142c-387a-301c-c9565db370ab"}]}
