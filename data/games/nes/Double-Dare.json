Like the TV show, the game is basically a trivia game with the added enhancement of being able to answer the question, or take a dare. Dares consist of the Toss-up Challenge, the Physical Challenge, and in the last round, the Obstacle Course. Questions are varied, and in large enough number to avoid excessive repetition even over several games worth of play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dare"}
