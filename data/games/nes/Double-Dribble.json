It was the second basketball arcade game by Konami, following Super Basketball. Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks, as well as The Star-Spangled Banner theme during attract mode, which was the first arcade game to feature the national anthem. These were uncommon in video games at the time of Double Dribble's release. While successful in the arcades, the game became and remained popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987.","total_rating":70.8001110043706,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dribble","videos":[{"id":28382,"game":4699,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"qvNjLDamuXE","checksum":"7dad32b8-3899-7bac-9213-4c44b66d0482"}]}
