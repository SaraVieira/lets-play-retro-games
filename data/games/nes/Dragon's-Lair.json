Dirk now has equipped throwing knives to launch at enemies rather than using his sword, and the game features gold collectibles.","summary":"Dragon's Lair is a side-scrolling platform game based on the laserdisc game of the same name released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by the MotiveTime group. Plotwise, the game is identical to the original.\n\nThe game is a side-scroller with the character walking slowly. Dirk can walk, crawl, or jump forward, and he has an array of weapons that he can discover and use to dispose of enemies. The controller layout is reversed from other mainstream NES titles, with Select functioning as the Pause-button while Start is used for the Candle object (which helps reveal hidden weapons). Also, B is used for jumping, and A for attacking (the input of the A & B buttons is almost always the opposite in similar NES games).","total_rating":51.76040381272405,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragons-lair--1","videos":[{"id":44535,"game":14529,"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"6q_9YKQtXEQ","checksum":"2a46c697-210f-a92d-e172-d039dc7708ff"}]}
