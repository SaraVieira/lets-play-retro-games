This isn’t your typical attack fighter, you’ll be flying sorties under the cover of night, avoiding detection by enemy radar and striking high-value targets with precision weaponry. You’ll want to haunt the battlefield like a ghost, menacing the enemy with earth-shattering ordnance before vanishing in your airborne apparition as suddenly as you appeared.\n\nWith a hardcore devotion to authenticity, F-117A brings you unprecedented night combat action. You’ll go through every phase of mission planning, from requesting a specific assignment during briefing to choosing your own munitions during armament, before then climbing into your cockpit and experiencing the thrill of dropping 1,000 lbs. of laser-guided destruction on enemy troops, tanks and bunkers. This is your chance to fly one of the most technologically impressive warplanes ever made.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nighthawk-f-117a-stealth-fighter-2-dot-0","videos":[{"id":18013,"game":10292,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"v4tTcK4z4qs","checksum":"dc183a4d-93c6-d277-16aa-f9d1d4dd52b9"}]}
