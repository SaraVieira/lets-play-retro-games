You'll have to walk along the ledges of the buildings and climb up the pipes to ascend to higher platforms in order to fix the windows. \n \nYou'll have plenty of obstacles blocking your path, as well as objects that Rusty throws down upon you (a bowling ball, bombs - which blows up windows if the shutters aren't closed, and game consoles).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/get-em-gary","videos":[{"id":44074,"game":142073,"name":"Dev Diary","video_id":"5XrDiIvQXp8","checksum":"29a2e946-e9e1-7a24-6233-b03f1fd7df6f"}]}
