You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys. Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved. The fighting is a little more in-depth than hack and slash. You can either fight with a defensive or offensive stance, or you can use magic spells.","total_rating":54.9006982041706,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hydlide"}
