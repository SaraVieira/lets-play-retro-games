Jay McCray, the son of a scientist responsible for development of space colony #428 in the Silius Solar System (SSS), prepares to move there in order to follow in his father's footsteps. However, the space station is obliterated in an explosion, killing the entire research team and destroying all data on board.\nIn his father's home, Jay discovers a floppy disk containing not only the complete SSS colony plans but a personal message from his father asking that he complete the projects should terrorists succeed in destroying the colony. To protect the colony plans and to avenge his father's death, Jay sets out to fight the terrorists responsible for the space colony's destruction.","summary":"Journey to Silius, known in Japan as RAF World, is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Tokai Engineering and published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.\n\nJourney to Silius was originally based on the 1984 film The Terminator, but the licensing rights to the film were lost during development. As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular terminator in the film.","total_rating":79.2271562688955,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/journey-to-silius","videos":[{"id":6188,"game":9159,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"9GG7fcVD18I","checksum":"6b77a37a-e81e-8639-ed66-b54f51ffcd44"}]}
