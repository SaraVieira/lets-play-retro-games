DUDE was content to spend its days and nights decoding complex algorithms and optimizing sprite sheets...until it deciphered a transmission from the surface that said its lab would be destroyed!\n\nHaving developed a will to survive and maximize the efficiency of artwork, DUDE searched through the laboratory for a way to escape. Luckily, the lab was once a factory for different kinds of robots.\n\nDUDE modified itself so it could interface with and control these robots and escape the lab, one room at a time. However, DUDE realized that many of the rooms in the factory were designed for testing these robots to see how they could work in unison.\n\nTo escape, DUDE knew what it must do. The AI had to become MULTIDUDE!","summary":"In MultiDude you control of a team of characters with various abilities, that must work together so all of them can reach available exits on each level. The ZX-Spectrum version uses multicolor (a software technique to combine more colours than normally possible without colour clash).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/multidude","videos":[{"id":43007,"game":141107,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"56M3YYEjDeU","checksum":"719cc5df-fe72-1725-2b47-cc5900b600e0"}]}
