As the name of the game implies, it is a golf game and was one of the first golfing games in the Mario series. You can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook.","total_rating":72.09213791030601,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nes-open-tournament-golf","videos":[{"id":35371,"game":3400,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"kceHby845NE","checksum":"afd38dd7-465e-280f-28da-292abfcf3aa4"}]}
