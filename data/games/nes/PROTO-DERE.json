Apparently, it’s a lost NES port of the old PROTO DERE arcade game which was showcased in 2017 for the AppSir launch party. I couldn’t find information about the game in any of the listings. It’s either an obsure bootleg, or a pre-production cart that never made it to release. Despite the internal damage on the game’s circuit board, I was able to rip the ROM so you guys can have a look at it. It’s filled with glitches, but I’m certain I didn’t corrupt the ROM. That’s how it played when I got it working on my dusty old NES, so maybe that’s why it was never released.”","summary":"The creation of the ancient PROTO DERE .NES led to AppSir's modern day hits DERE .EXE and DERE EVIL .EXE. For 33 years, the cartridge could not be found.\n\nWhile not as big as AppSir's modern titles, it was an important artifact that was sought after for decades.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/proto-dere-nes","videos":[{"id":43933,"game":141912,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ySyUFjLC60s","checksum":"952620d7-d80e-4704-6cde-3280996fdb13"}]}
