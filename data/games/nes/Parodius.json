The series is available on numerous platforms.\n\nThe game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius--2","videos":[{"id":55566,"game":174923,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"8wQGgMgpPxw","checksum":"fe655d9c-7736-8858-1dfa-d26d83cec185"}]}
