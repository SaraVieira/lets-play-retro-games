The game has two screens to represent the traditional pinball table and one for a bonus mode. Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from first screen through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. If the ball falls through the hole to the right bottom at the top level, the player will enter a mini-game featuring Mario and Lady. The player controls the paddles on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.","total_rating":69.48867447122839,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball--3","videos":[{"id":27606,"game":86428,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"-Ed4PTls3Wo","checksum":"509bd434-a5f8-d860-0365-b76098220d8a"}]}
