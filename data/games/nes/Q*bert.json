No significant story was developed for the game, partly due to the original inception as an arcade game.","summary":"Q*bert was a popular arcade game that was released on a large number of consoles in the early 1980s. It was developed and published by Gottlieb, and became their most successful game. The concept serves as a precursor to the isometric platformer genre, where the title character must work to turn all cubes to a certain colour in a psuedo-3D world, made 3D through isometric graphics in the same way that the Penrose Stairs was made. The game was widely successful and has become a highly recognizable brand of the 1980s gaming era.","total_rating":63.16401536164315,"total_rating_count":31,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/q-bert"}
