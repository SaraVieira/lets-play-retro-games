The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air. The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.","total_rating":79.79583786623989,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/silkworm"}
