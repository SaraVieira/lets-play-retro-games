The object is to navigate the obstacles in each level and eat enough \"Nibbley Pibbleys\" to ring a weigh-in bell located in the level, which will allow the snakes to exit. The game can be played by a single player or by two players simultaneously.\n\nIt was later re released as part of Rare Replay collection on Xbox One.","total_rating":76.2577833000307,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snake-rattle-n-roll","videos":[{"id":22584,"game":4479,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"_Mq1kJ25LVA","checksum":"e5927a10-ab37-6227-78b8-559617d03641"}]}
