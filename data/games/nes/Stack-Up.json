In others, Hector competes for control of R.O.B. against \"glitches\" named Spike & Flipper, or against Professor Vector.","summary":"Stack-Up is a video game released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, designed for use with the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by collectors to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stack-up","videos":[{"id":3367,"game":8579,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Z0z79jq3sZ0","checksum":"4e93e95f-92e4-d6cf-a93a-21e45b8eb901"}]}
