As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.\n\nA player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the \"What is...\" question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/talking-super-jeopardy"}
