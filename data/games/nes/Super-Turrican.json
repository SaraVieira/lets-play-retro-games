The entire game was developed by Manfred Trenz alone.\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics are more similar to the second game, though a run button has been added along with the ability to jump out of Gyroscope form in mid-air, vastly increasing the player's maneuverability, though the Gyroscope now bounces off of enemies as well.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-turrican--1","videos":[{"id":64645,"game":191878,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"etLUjXpgJp0","checksum":"1b1f0775-58a8-fd2c-fdfc-af27c741ed41"}]}
