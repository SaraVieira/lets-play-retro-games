Player(s) can take control of either Jake or Elwood Blues. Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level. The sixth and final level ends on-stage.","summary":"The Blues Brothers video game was designed by Titus Software and is based on the comedic sketch band of the same name. The platformer-style game was released in 1991 for MS-DOS.
