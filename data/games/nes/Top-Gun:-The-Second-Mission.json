Well, before polishing your ego, you've gotta survive a second mission that's ten times more deadly than the first. Soaring against an Armageddon bound armada of planes, tanks, ships, and satellite laser beams, every ounce of your skill and courage will be drained as you fight fire with fire, while out-maneuvering anti-aircraft blasts, cannon bursts and heat seeking missiles that are looking to roast your tail.","summary":"Top Gun: The Second Mission, known as Top Gun: Duel Fighters in Japan, is a combat flight game developed and published by Konami and released on NES platforms on 1989. It is a sequel to the NES version of Top Gun.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/top-gun-the-second-mission","videos":[{"id":27265,"game":22911,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"XNp0fX9pEfw","checksum":"90120540-e4e5-911e-ee08-fb0349a61db5"},{"id":48972,"game":22911,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Z_4XYdvpsdI","checksum":"8f50b8ee-f3c0-7bbc-d244-4be7a364db7c"}]}
