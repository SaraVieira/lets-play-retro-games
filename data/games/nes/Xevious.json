You are controlling Solvalou with its anti-aircraft missiles and surface bombs. Your goal is to destroy the enemy and proceed on your mission.","summary":"It's a nightmare, but it's true! Research shows that we are the actual aliens on Earth, and the ruthless Xevions are the original inhabitants.\n\nNow the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.\n\nOur puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.\n\nThe mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!\n\nOne small problem. We still need a pilot.
