But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies. \n \nBut wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown! \n \nThere are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth. \n \nFinally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth. \n \nFor 1 Ninja Master.","total_rating":76,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zen-intergalactic-ninja","videos":[{"id":29096,"game":48251,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"IRxOwmRpOgc","checksum":"4942a50b-0b1a-2e98-ffee-e06fd7351e70"}]}
