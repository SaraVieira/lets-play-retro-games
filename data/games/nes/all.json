On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.\n\n10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an \"accelerated real time\" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.",

    "summary": "The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.\n\nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.",

This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.\n\nThese strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!\n\nThe task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.\n\nThen, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!",

    "storyline": "In the year 5012, the planet known as Abadox is soon eaten by a giant alien organism known as Parasitis. Once the planet has been consumed, the alien takes the form of the entire planet and seeks to devour other planets within the galaxy. The galactic military tries to fight the alien, but to no avail as Parasitis destroys the entire galactic military, except for one hospital ship. It is then discovered that Princess Maria has been devoured as well. The galactic military decides to send out their best fighter, \"Second Lieutenant Nazal\", to attempt to enter Parasitis' body and rescue Princess Maria before it's too late.",
    "summary": "Abadox is a video game for the NES, subtitled The Deadly Inner War. It is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up in the vein of Gradius and R-Type. The game is notable for its unique visual design, as the game takes place inside the intestinal tract of a giant alien organism. Abadox is also known to be difficult, since it takes one hit from an enemy projectile to be killed. In Abadox, if a player is killed, one must restart from a checkpoint passed before death.",

The Space Federation sends their mightiest fleet, but they are quickly eliminated by the powerful Fortresses. In a final gambit, they send a single warrior (Hal Bailman), outfitted with a shielded spacesuit, powerful weapons, and small lightship to infiltrate the Fortresses and destroy them from the inside out.",

    "summary": "Arkanoid - Revenge of Doh (a.k.a. Arkanoid 2) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1987 as a sequel to Arkanoid.\n\nThe mysterious enemy known as DOH has returned to seek vengeance on the Vaus space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus (paddle) and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64.\n\nNEW FEATURES:\nRevenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of \"Warp Gates\". Upon completion of a level or when the Break (\"B\") pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom of the play area, on either side. The player can choose to go through either one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next level is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser Cannons (\"L\") or Catch (\"C\") pill is caught.\n\nThe game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.\n\nThe US version features an entirely different layout for Level 1 that feature an entire line of notched bricks, with all colored bricks above it moving from side to side.\n\nThe game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH.\n\nHome versions of Revenge of DOH also featured a level editor, where players could create their own levels or edit and replace existing levels, with the exception of two levels: the mini-boss and DOH.",

The game was originally released in a box that featured the Family Fun Fitness logo. When Nintendo later purchased the rights to the FFF pad, the game was re-released with a different label-featuring the Athletic World name.

The player would play a game until the other player was defeated-the games could go on indefinitely until that occurs. The game kept track of what teams had been defeated by giving the player a password at the end of each victory, which could be entered into the game to return to the spot where the player was. The game also kept track of the pitcher's stamina, which meant that some rotation was necessary throughout the different games.",

It followed the rules of baseball for the most part, with the addition of some cartoonish features that made the game more attractive to kids.",

    "summary": "Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console. A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)",

Players were able to create players and teams, even going so far as naming these elements. As well, the game introduced managerial controls, such as the ability to earn money, gain prestige, and upgrade players on the roster. David Littman, a producer on EA's NHL series of games, has said that the popular GM mode in the NHL games was inspired by Baseball Stars, so the influence it has has continued.\nGameplay involved taking part in a season, or simply a one-off versus mode. The rules of the game stayed true to baseball, and the realism was seen as being far beyond anything that had come prior to its release.",

It is often referred to as the best baseball game on the NES platform, and introduced a number of key features that have become standard in modern sports games, such as \"create player\" and \"create team\" functions.",

    "summary": "Battle Chess was developed by Interplay as their first project after severing ties with Electronic Arts. They designed it for the Amiga in 1988, and it was released on the majority of the other systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s as well. It was widely successful, and resulted in two follow-ups, many copy-cat games, and a remake for Steam on PC. The only significant criticism the game received was the weak chess AI, as it was not until the mid 1990s that chess ai began to consistently win against strong opponents.",

Co-designed by Winston Cup Champion Bill Elliott and Distinctive Software- developed or Test Drive and The Duel- this is a test of your mettle and milliseconds on the banked ovals of six official, perfectly scaled NASCAR tracks like Daytona, Talladega, Bristol, Darlington, Michigan and Atlanta. Or the two twisting road courses of Sears Point or Watkins Glen. All with bit map graphics plus a scaling technique, creating graphics so detailed you can actually read the car's make when you go bumper to bumper.\n\nOn-screen statistics tell you course length, maximum banking and the total number of laps in each race. With this vital data, adapt your car to each unique track by adjusting gear ratio, transmission, spoiler angle and tire stagger. Depending on whether you're racing or qualifying for pole position, you must also decide which type of engine to use. But \"dial in\" your car carefully. One miscalculation could send you reeling into the wall.\n\nWhen you think you have the right stuff, drop the hammer on NASCAR's finest field of racers- including Bill Elliott himself- in single races or compete for the Cup in the Championship Season.",

His arm allows him to grab on to fixed objects to swing around and climb up platforms, which is the only way to do so due to the lack of a jumping ability. The arm also grabs opponents and pulls them towards the player character.",

You can also choose from three difficulty levels - Junior, College and Pro.\nThroughout the game, you'll constantly be tested by every intense element of championship hockey, from Penalty and Overtime Scenes to Knockout Smash-Hit Fight Scenes. Speed, strength, quickness and instinct are talents you must possess if you plan to prevail, especially when the anger flares, gloves come off and fists start flying.\n\nIt's hard hitting action at its toughest. And you'll soon learn that in this league nothing's ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you have to score them. You've gotta master the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You'd better be versatile as well, because you must skillfully control your forwards, centers, defensemen and even the goalie, who'll defend the net against unrelenting Power Plays (which will occur if you lose a fight and have your battered carcass banned to the Penalty Box).",

    "summary": "This video game is based on the cartoon television series Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars under license from Hasbro, Inc. While it is generally classified as a scrolling fighting game, utilizing a Final Fight-esque landscape, the player's character is also armed with a laser gun, adding in elements of a scrolling shooter. However, if the character is extremely close to an enemy, he will throw out his fists to attack - a precursor to the characters featured in Metal Slug, who use knives in close combat.\n\nMuch like the cartoon, Bucky O'Hare features colorful animation, and voice actors from the series were hired to participate in the game's cut scenes.\n\nThe player chooses from five protagonists: Bucky O'Hare, the heroic rabbit captain of the space ship Righteous Indignation; Jenny, an \"Aldebaran cat\" and telepath; Dead-Eye Duck, a four-armed mallard; Willy, a kid from earth that replaced their engineer, and Blinky, a one-eyed android. As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as \"Komplex\" and release the \"Interplanetary Life Force.\"\n\nThe enemies, among them Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror Toad, a \"Cyborg Spider\", the various varieties of Toad Storm Troopers, the Toads' Air Marshall, and \"Komplex-2-Go\" who featured in the comic book and cartoon series continuities.",

For thousands of years, their vast mental capabilities have been focused upon one goal: the conquest of the universe! To accomplish this, they are creating huge armies of robo-mutants - bizarre creatures, half robot and half living flesh. With their seven manufacturing bases producing thousands of robo-mutants each day, the Burai armies will soon overrun the galaxy - unless you can stop them! Strap on your proton pack, charge up your laser cannon, and prepare to do battle with the deadliest army of mutant rogues in the universe. You must somehow penetrate the seven bases of the Burai, where you will confront a super-mutant guarding each base - monstrous creatures like the Giganticrab, Jawsipede, and Fangskull - until finally, you face the terrifying Slimedragon! But with the awesome arsenal of weapons at your command, victory may still be within your reach. It's up to you to rid the universe of the evil Burai once and for all!",

    "summary": "Introducing the gnarliest bunch of games under the sun. Games invented on the beaches by sun-baked beach bums with a fondness for ripping, grinding, and shredding. With six radically thrilling events intended to bring you to the edge and blow your mind. And make adrenaline California's most plentiful natural resource.\n\nWish they all could be California Games.\nGet ready to shred the face off an awesomely tubular wave. Turn a \"berm\" on a BMX bike and spray up a wall of dirt. Launch a few feet off-the-lip with your skateboard tucked high. And while you're up there, dance for the crowd. Or if you're feeling like kicking back a bit, float a flying disk, juggle a foot bag with your heels, or just slalom the boardwalk on skates.\n\nWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\nBut this ain't beach blanket bingo. In fact, before you even set foot on California turf, you'll choose an on-screen sponsor from among the heaviest names on the circuit. Then, hit the competition route. Prizes include trophies for a single event and a top prize in overall competition.\n\nSo get air. Go crazy. Welcome to a new state of intensity.\n\nCalifornia Games was the original \"Extreme Games\" – what today's generation might call \"X-Games in the sun\". Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.\n\nThe Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.",

The game takes place in the fictional town of Lost Wages (a pun on the real city of Las Vegas, Nevada) where the object is to earn lots of money and to defeat the evil King of the Casino. Games at the casino include blackjack and five-card draw poker. In the Japanese version, it was possible to travel to other casinos like New York City and Japan for a substantial airfare cost.",

You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.\n\nThe game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.\n\nTowers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.",

Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.",

Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!",

After a search of the ship turns up nothing, Zipper then spots Fat Cat running into a warehouse. Chip and Dale follow him inside, but are ambushed and locked in a refrigerator to freeze. Though the chipmunks escape in time, Fat Cat opens the Urn and releases the evil spirits contained within it.",

Join Chip and Dale and the rest of the Rangers in their wacky new adventure. Help them explore the dangerous levels of the downtown restaurant and meet the exploding personality of Water Rabbit.

This will take him right to that level's boss battle.\nBonus levels include such fun things as guiding a bear to jump over flames, avoiding boulders in a car, using Rodan as target practice and meeting Godzilla at the circus grounds.",

The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate. \n \nThe plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.",

The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.\nThere are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.",

    "summary": "Theodore \"Todd\" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.",

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play.",

To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.",

Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.",

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.",

The game was also released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 22, 2008 and in Europe and Australia on October 31, 2008. The game has similar gameplay to that of Pac-Man. It is the only game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto that has not been released in North America, despite the fact that the game is simple and in English. This was due to Nintendo of America's strict policies on the use of religious icons in games, which were at their strictest level at the time of the game's original release.",

The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited.

These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nIn the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.",

    "summary": "Technōs created once again a vastly different experience with Double Dragon II on the NES. The experience system was dropped, but the moveset still underwent a few changes. The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.\n\nThe PC Engine CD version by Naxat Soft is surprisingly modeled closely after the NES game, from featuring mostly the same levels down to the rule of having no more than two enemies on screen at a time. But it does mix and match different types together, and in general extends the stages with additional hoodlums. There are a few other notable structural differences – namely, the fight on the huge moving bulldozer at the end of the forest level is missing, but to make up for its omission, the Lee brothers actually have to fight Willy before they meet their own shadows like in the arcade game. They also get to face the Shadow Master (now without the cape) on any difficulty level, although you miss out on the second round in a church and the good ending with Marion revived unless you beat the game on the Hard difficulty mode.",

    "summary": "The NES version of Double Dragon takes a wide range of liberties with the interpretation. The entire graphical style is more in line with Technōs’ Kunio-kun series, with characters that go for exaggerated expression rather than gritty realism.\n\nThe biggest change, however, was reserved for the moveset. You start the game with only the punch, kick and headbutt available – all the other moves are obtained via an RPG-lite style experience system. Hitting enemies is now rewarded with a certain amount of experience points depending on the attack, and each time the counter goes above 999, you’re awarded an additional heart, which extends the range of possible actions. Two hearts add the uppercut and roundhouse kick combo finishers, and with three Billy can perform the jump kick maneuver. The fourth heart unlocks access to grappling moves.\n\nThe Game Boy rendition of Double Dragon plays like somewhat of a mix between the arcade and NES versions, although it’s closer to the latter. The controls are all NES, but the RPG elements were dropped and Billy got all his moves ready from the start. The ground attack is gone, but so is the head butt, making for a rather slim arsenal of maneuvers. The game is mostly based on the NES version except for Abobo, who looks even more deformed and has learned Burnov’s grapple from Double Dragon II. The second stage has become even more elaborate, and later parts include some of the new traps from the NES Double Dragon II like the floor that starts giving away.",

Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks, as well as The Star-Spangled Banner theme during attract mode, which was the first arcade game to feature the national anthem. These were uncommon in video games at the time of Double Dribble's release. While successful in the arcades, the game became and remained popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987.",

Armed with only a Knife in the beginning, as Michael moves through the house, he can pick up Handgun Bullets, Machine Gun Bullets, Grenades and life-replenishing Yellow Vitamins and Red Vitamins. There is a menu which has four options, open, get, go, and hit. There are 11 Warp Zones in all. At the end of each of the first 10 Warp Zones, Michael must fight a large monster that carries a piece of the Laser and guards a valuable piece of equipment, the latter consisting of the Ultra Space Sensor, four Life Bottles, the Air Helmet, the Jump Boots, two Blue Vitamins and the Shield Suit. Once Michael fully assembles the Laser, he'll be able to challenge the final boss, Canbarian.",

As he walks to the church with his cane in hand, several townspeople, animals, and other obstacles accost him, causing him to become angry. If his anger reaches a certain level, he transforms into Mr. Hyde and is taken to a nightmarish world of monsters. As Mr. Hyde kills these monsters, his anger abates and eventually he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll.\n\nThere are two endings to the game. The normal ending occurs when Dr. Jekyll reaches the church at the end of the sixth level. Dr. Jekyll weds Miss Millicent and 'END' is displayed with the wedding march playing in the background. The alternative ending occurs when Mr. Hyde reaches the church. In this case, a boss named Letule appears. After defeating the boss, Mr. Hyde transforms back into Dr. Jekyll. A more detailed scene of the wedding is shown with Dr. Jekyll kissing Miss Millicent. The screen fades with 'END' displayed, and lightning strikes a few moments later. A silhouette of what appears to be Mr. Hyde with a cross inserted into his back appears.",

This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it falls, moving it left or right and rotating it such that it is positioned alongside the viruses and any existing capsules. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck.",

Dirk can walk, crawl, or jump forward, and he has an array of weapons that he can discover and use to dispose of enemies. The controller layout is reversed from other mainstream NES titles, with Select functioning as the Pause-button while Start is used for the Candle object (which helps reveal hidden weapons). Also, B is used for jumping, and A for attacking (the input of the A & B buttons is almost always the opposite in similar NES games).",

Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).\n\nThis port also has less stages than the original game.",

    "storyline": "The Beagle Boys attempt another raid on Scrooge's money bin, with Baggy, Burger and Bouncer Beagle capturing Huey, Dewey and Louie. After Scrooge rescues them, he finds Big Time Beagle in his office with a painting in his hands. With the help of Duckworth, Big Time is defeated and retreats. The painting reveals the locations of five treasures, and Scrooge wastes no time to set out for them. Scrooge and Launchpad visit the Amazon to find the Sceptre of the Incan King. Using eight golden coins, they uncover the hidden temple of Manco Capquack, but the sceptre is lost and the temple is destroyed by its guardian statue. The chief of the natives then approaches Scrooge and Launchpad and thanks them for returning their city to them, and gives Scrooge the recovered sceptre in return, which was just the king's back scratcher. Scrooge, the nephews and Webby visit the castle of Drake Von Vladstone, also known as Dracula Duck, who was the heir to the Coin of the Lost Realm. The boys fall into a trap door and are spread throughout the Transylvanian mansion, but Scrooge saves them from the Beagle Boys, disguised as ghosts. Each of the beagle boys were also carrying a torn sheet of paper which contained part of a riddle. They uncover a mirror where Scrooge solves the riddle, and Magica De Spell reveals herself, who is also after the coin. Scrooge and Magica then face off for it, and the sorceress is defeated and retreats empty-handed. Scrooge and the nephews travel to the African Mines to find the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth, but they find the workers are being scared off by voices and earthquakes, claiming the mine is haunted. Deep underground, Scrooge discovers that the Terra-Firmians and their games are the cause, and after interfering he is attacked by their king. Defeated, the king makes an agreement with Scrooge to stop the games in exchange for the mining operations to continue, as it will rid them of the diamonds they consider to be \"garbage rocks\". He gives Scrooge the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth to start with.",

After Scrooge rescues them, he finds Big Time Beagle in his office with a painting in his hands. With the help of Duckworth, Big Time is defeated and retreats. The painting reveals the locations of five treasures, and Scrooge wastes no time to set out for them. Scrooge and Launchpad visit the Amazon to find the Sceptre of the Incan King. Using eight golden coins, they uncover the hidden temple of Manco Capquack, but the sceptre is lost and the temple is destroyed by its guardian statue. The chief of the natives then approaches Scrooge and Launchpad and thanks them for returning their city to them, and gives Scrooge the recovered sceptre in return, which was just the king's back scratcher. Scrooge, the nephews and Webby visit the castle of Drake Von Vladstone, also known as Dracula Duck, who was the heir to the Coin of the Lost Realm. The boys fall into a trap door and are spread throughout the Transylvanian mansion, but Scrooge saves them from the Beagle Boys, disguised as ghosts. Each of the beagle boys were also carrying a torn sheet of paper which contained part of a riddle. They uncover a mirror where Scrooge solves the riddle, and Magica De Spell reveals herself, who is also after the coin. Scrooge and Magica then face off for it, and the sorceress is defeated and retreats empty-handed. Scrooge and the nephews travel to the African Mines to find the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth, but they find the workers are being scared off by voices and earthquakes, claiming the mine is haunted. Deep underground, Scrooge discovers that the Terra-Firmians and their games are the cause, and after interfering he is attacked by their king. Defeated, the king makes an agreement with Scrooge to stop the games in exchange for the mining operations to continue, as it will rid them of the diamonds they consider to be \"garbage rocks\". He gives Scrooge the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth to start with.",

He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, \"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.\"",

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races.

At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.",

The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\". \n \nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.",

This isn’t your typical attack fighter, you’ll be flying sorties under the cover of night, avoiding detection by enemy radar and striking high-value targets with precision weaponry. You’ll want to haunt the battlefield like a ghost, menacing the enemy with earth-shattering ordnance before vanishing in your airborne apparition as suddenly as you appeared.\n\nWith a hardcore devotion to authenticity, F-117A brings you unprecedented night combat action. You’ll go through every phase of mission planning, from requesting a specific assignment during briefing to choosing your own munitions during armament, before then climbing into your cockpit and experiencing the thrill of dropping 1,000 lbs. of laser-guided destruction on enemy troops, tanks and bunkers. This is your chance to fly one of the most technologically impressive warplanes ever made.",

Worse still, the town is under attack by Dwarves.The Elven king explains that the Elf fountain water, their life source, has stopped and provides the protagonist with 1500 golds, the games currency, to prepare for his journey to uncover the cause.As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Elves and Dwarfs lived in harmony among the World Tree until The Evil One emerged from a fallen meteorite. The Evil One then transformed the Dwarves into monsters against their will and set them against the Elves. The Dwarf King, Grieve, swallowed his magical sword before he was transformed, hiding it in his own body to prevent The Evil One from acquiring it. It is only with this sword that The Evil One can be destroyed.His journey takes him to four overworld areas: The tree's buttress, the inside of the trunk, the tree's branches and finally the Dwarves' mountain stronghold.",

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game. \nBefore the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.",

    "summary": "In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.",

Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.",

    "summary": "The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.",

    "summary": "Gemfire is a marvelous war strategy from KOEI game collection. The game offers the advanced military strategy and even multiplayer support, but only at the shared screen. The story of the game starts as follows:\n\nOnce upon a time, Ishmeria was a haven for elves, fairies and other creatures of lore. Yet one day an evil wizard wielded the powers of a Fire Dragon to destroy the peace. A legendary Pastha and 6 magicians fought the wizard and trapped the Dragon. But, the wizard cast a fateful curse, turning the magicians and Dragon into cold gems, which were placed upon the crown: The Gemfire.\nGemfire's powers preserved peace in Ishmeria, until King Eselred abused the magic for his greed. Then one day, the Pastha came to Princess Robyn to plea for her help. That very night she stole the crown and hurled the gems into the midnight sky! But before she could destroy the Dragon's ruby, King Eselred caught Robyn and seized the crown!\n\nIn search of virtuous leaders, the magicians flew to the far corners of Ishmeria. Still,to this day, they struggle against Eselred's wrath. The key to saving Ishmeria is in the hands of one ruler, the ruler who will reunite the magic of Gemfire...",

    "storyline": "Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to \"bust\" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.",
    "summary": "Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).",

Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.",

This is primarily evident in two of the weapons configurations that are selectable. Another first in the series was the inclusion of the \"boss rush\" (also known as \"boss parade\" or \"boss alley\"), a level designed entirely with only boss confrontations.\n\nGradius II retains the selection bar from Gradius, but now the player can choose between four different weapon configurations and progressions. All schemes have speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double' (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples. Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of the entire spacecraft, withstanding three hits and it is included in four different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have to be activated twice to achieve full performance.",

Whereas Commando is a run and gun game, this game is a scrolling shooter in which the screen scrolls upward automatically and players only have three ways to shoot, using three buttons for left, right, and center shooting. However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.\n\nIt was brought to the Sega Master System in South Korea without a license by Prosoft in 1990.",

Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.\n\nGyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.\n\nThe game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is similar in sound to \"Toccata\", a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky.\n\nGyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits. The game used three microprocessors: two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips and a DAC.\n\nGyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.\n\nR.Hirst \"KOO\", M.Jones, \"BOX\" and the Elliott Brother's are arguably considered some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990's.",

    "summary": "Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East.\n\nTerrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK's Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.\nThe name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.",

Players have to either agree or disagree with fictitious celebrities to earn squares and make tic-tac-toe. Much like the TV series, winning one of the first two games is worth $500, the third game is worth $1,000 and the second game is always the \"Secret Square\" game. The winner then goes on to the bonus round, where they have to choose one of five keys and insert it into the proper car among the five offered. This version was based on the 1980's version hosted by John Davidson",

    "storyline": "The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.",

Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits. \n \nOnly your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races.

In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain. \nIt also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels. \nJack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade. The two companies developed it into a video game franchise, and Accolade published numerous adaptations and sequels for more than ten years.",

    "summary": "This adaptation of the animated TV series differs significantly from its NES namesake. The nephew of Agent 007 must foil the plans of malevolent S.C.U.M. agents, who are hunting for rare artifacts that would allow them to dominate the world. Unlike the NES game, this version is a more action-oriented side-scrolling game without detailed mission objectives or puzzle-solving.\n\nThe game consists of three levels, each beginning with a section in which Bond pilots a helicopter, a boat, and a jet, respectively. These are controlled in arcade-like fashion, similarly to side-scrolling shooters. Enemies must be dealt with using weapons mounted on the craft. Various hazards are scattered through the stages, requiring the player to react quickly in order to stay alive.",

Two players may play competitively. The Game Boy version of the game allows two-player competitive play over a Game Link Cable.\n\nIn french markets, Jimmy Connors was replaced with Yannick Noah as the title athlete.",

    "summary": "Journey to Silius, known in Japan as RAF World, is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Tokai Engineering and published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.\n\nJourney to Silius was originally based on the 1984 film The Terminator, but the licensing rights to the film were lost during development. As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular terminator in the film.",

Using his magic powers the wizard quickly overpowered the helpless people, put everybody including Princess Mira, into \"dream bags\", and turned the entire kingdom into a frozen wasteland.\n\nIt is your job as Kickle to progress through all of the areas within each of the four lands in the country and eliminate all of the Wizard's henchmen and rescue your friends who are held captive in a dreamless sleep.\n\nKickle Cubicle is a captivating puzzle game much on the lines of the old coin-op game Pengo. More recently though, it contains similar concepts seen in the Lolo series of NES carts where planning and strategy is more important than quick moves.\n\nYour main weapon is your 'chilling' ice breath. Breathe on the enemy and they instantly freeze! Give them a kick and they're out of your way! Clear a couple dozen mazes and you come to the end of the land you're in where you must then beat one of the Boss creatures.\n\nThrow in springs, hammers, bonus stages and secret traps and the game quickly turns into a puzzle game with levels which start easy but increase in difficulty as you get better!",

    "storyline": "The game is set in Angel Land, which is a fantasy world with a Greek mythology theme. The backstory of Kid Icarus is described in the instruction booklet: before the events of the game, Earth was ruled by Palutena: Goddess of Light and Medusa: Goddess of Darkness. Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished her to the Underworld. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena's residence the Palace in the Sky. She launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena's army of its power. After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky.\n\nWith her last power, she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. He escapes from his prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land. Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld. Afterward, he equips himself with the treasures and storms the sky temple where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena. The game has five different endings; depending on the player's performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform him into a full-grown angel.",
    "summary": "Kid Icarus is an action platform video game for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan and the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and North America.\nThe plot of Kid Icarus revolves around protagonist Pit's quest for three sacred treasures, which he must equip to rescue the Grecian fantasy world Angel Land and its ruler, the goddess Palutena. The player controls Pit through platform areas while fighting monsters and collecting items. Their objective is to reach the end of the levels, and to find and defeat boss monsters that guard the three treasures.",

It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.\n\nThe first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:\n\nRay Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.\n\nIt is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.",

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!",

For hundreds of years, DARK has governed with wisdom and justice.\n\nBut now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress.\n\nArmed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus!\n\nRobot warships and floating mines are a constant menace. And you must beware of the Giant Head, a grotesque stone face guarding the entrance to each of DARK's underground bases. If you approach too near to its gaping mouth, you will be sucked into the depths, where bizarre mutant monsters prowl the corridors.\n\nIf you fail, mankind is lost. Take wing, Legendary Soldiers!",
    "summary": "Legendary Wings (Aresu no Tsubasa, \"The Wings of Ares\") is a fantasy-themed shoot-'em-up game released by Capcom as a coin-operated video game in 1986. The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer.\nLegendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \"Dark\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival.\nThe coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at any time or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in which the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score.",

    "summary": "Log Jammers is a homebrew arcade sports game. It is similar to the PC and console versions of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from Windjammers, which served as an inspiration.\n\nPlayers select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.\n\nIn a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.\n\nThe opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.\n\nThe game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.",

And you can become the richest, most powerful inhabitant of the newly discovered planet by owning the most land, mining the most precious metal, and supplying the most food and energy to all the peasants - otherwise known as your opponents. To win you need MULEs (Multiple Use Labor Elements), kind of mechanical donkeys which do your dirty work: growing food, mining, and producing energy. MULEs are critical, so you want to get as many as possible as cheaply as possible. And by the way, treachery is acceptable. So use it when needed. Then sit back and enjoy your wealth and power, OH MIGHTY RULER!",
    "summary": "M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game. \n \nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level. \n \nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town. \n \nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.",

    "storyline": "The game takes place in the mansion of the fictional Edison family: Dr. Fred, a mad scientist; Nurse Edna, his wife; and their son Weird Ed. Living with the Edisons are two large, disembodied tentacles, one purple and the other green. The intro sequence shows that a sentient meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier; it brainwashed the Edisons and directed Dr. Fred to obtain human brains for use in experiments. The game begins as Dave Miller prepares to enter the mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy Pantz, who had been kidnapped by Dr. Fred. With the exception of the green tentacle, the mansion's inhabitants are hostile, and will throw the player characters into the dungeon—or, in some situations, kill them—if they see them. When a character dies, the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters; and the game ends if all characters are killed. Maniac Mansion has five possible endings, based on which characters are chosen, which survive, and what the characters accomplish.",
    "summary": "Maniac Mansion is a 1987 graphic adventure video game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a point-and-click interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is nonlinear, and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm Games' first self-published product.",

    "summary": "Marble Madness is an isometric platform game in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim of the game is for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. When a player completes a race, the remaining time is added to the next race's allotted time. The game also allows two players to compete against each other.\n\nCourses are populated with various objects and enemies designed to obstruct the player. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race, titled \"Practice\", is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race, named \"Silly\", features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite from the other courses",

Dr. Light, and his assistant Dr. Wily, encouraged by their very first near-human robot - Mega Man - proceeded to develop six additional Humanoids, all programmed to perform prescribed rituals.\n\nBut, with the exception of Mega Man, all of Dr. Light's near-human robot experimentation went awry. Assistant Dr. Wily turned disloyal, re-programming Dr. Light's Humanoids, now bent on destroying opposition so Dr. Wily could control the world and its resources.\n\nResisting re-programming, Mega Man is chosen as the defender of the universe and its inhabitants. Mega Man dares to single-handedly penetrate seven separate empires of Monsteropolis, eliminating the leaders and followers of these sovereignties.",

    "summary": "A platform game where the main character travels throughout various levels collecting bombs. The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs. Series version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version. Differences between the original and vs. series versions include adding a two-player mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a warp trick in the Royal Palace rooms. In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl",

    "summary": "Punch-Out!!, originally released in North America as Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, is a boxing sports fighting video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) developed and published by Nintendo in 1987. Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.\nPunch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.\nLittle Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.\nLittle Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.\nA bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.\nWhen Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.",

Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!",

    "summary": "IT IS MANKIND'S DARKEST DAY!\n\nThe shadows of doom grow long as the ancient Egyptian villain Sutekh envelops Metro City with a wave of crime. But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike the world has even seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom.\n\nBy day this brave crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you.\n\nEvery night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling one hundred of the city's darkest corners, including King Rat's filthy underground hideout and the League of Unreasonable Gentlemen. Here you'll find thieves, muggers and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray.\n\nTo overcome these treacherous obstacles, you must seek out hidden weapons, including energy domes, force gloves and The Staff of Ra. More importantly, you must use problem solving skills to outsmart five crime kings who hold the inner secrets to Sutekh's Lair.\n\nOf course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wits to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember. If this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.",

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor. \n \nThe game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.",

Thus, as in reality, the player may choose to advance deep into the South or North, to attack in the center or to attempt a turning movement.\n\nThis game can be played against computer or between two human opponents. You can also choose between a full strategic mode without the arcade parts or use the arcade mode during the fights, which allows you to directly control your own units.",

    "summary": "Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. \n \nAs the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four \"buffer\" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact. \n \nTo make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can. \n \nThe player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option. \n \nBlood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.",

I couldn’t find information about the game in any of the listings. It’s either an obsure bootleg, or a pre-production cart that never made it to release. Despite the internal damage on the game’s circuit board, I was able to rip the ROM so you guys can have a look at it. It’s filled with glitches, but I’m certain I didn’t corrupt the ROM. That’s how it played when I got it working on my dusty old NES, so maybe that’s why it was never released.”",

    "summary": "Paperboy is a 1985 arcade game by Atari Games originally developed in 1984 . The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.\n\nThe game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.\n\nControlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.\n\nDelivering the papers\nThe paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.\n\nIn Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street.\nThe primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.\n\nKeeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.\n\nThe player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.\n\nThere are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.\n\nAlong the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.\n\nA 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.\n\nTraining course\nPaperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker.\nThe end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.\n\nFinish line bug\nA bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.\n\nRecapping the delivery\nThe next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.\n\nThe game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.\n\nLosing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"\n\nThe arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.\n\nPORTS:\nPaperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.\n\nUnlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.\n\nMore recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003.\nA Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.\n\nPaperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.\n\nAn iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.",

    "summary": "The excitement of one of the America's most popular party games comes to the NES with Pictionary. Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people.\n\nThe basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins.\n\nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include \"Attack of the Paint Zombies\" (similar to Space Invaders), \"The Warehouse Shuffle\" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), \"Four Alarm Rescue\" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and \"Leapin' Energy Casules!\" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship).\n\nThere are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.",

Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge!

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them. \n \nThe game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.",

    "summary": "Puzznic is a tile-matching puzzle arcade game developed and produced by Taito in 1989 and was ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, PC Engine, Sharp X68000, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MS-DOS and ZX Spectrum between 1990 and 1991. Home computer ports were handled by Ocean Software; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. An Apple IIgs port was completed in 1990, however was never commercially released (a leaked copy was however circulated). A clone for the PC, Brix, was released by Epic MegaGames in 1992. The Japanese arcade and FM Towns version has adult content during game play; a naked woman is revealed at the end of the level.\n\nPuzznic bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Flipull/Plotting. An indie remake was made in 2009 for iPhone, called Gem Panic, and a range of Puzznic clones called 'Puzzle Magic' have appeared on mobiles. Many games share the same basic gameplay of Puzznic but have added extra features over the years:- Puzztrix on the web and on PC, Addled and Germinal on the iPhone, Puzzled on mobile phones.",

    "summary": "Q*bert was a popular arcade game that was released on a large number of consoles in the early 1980s. It was developed and published by Gottlieb, and became their most successful game. The concept serves as a precursor to the isometric platformer genre, where the title character must work to turn all cubes to a certain colour in a psuedo-3D world, made 3D through isometric graphics in the same way that the Penrose Stairs was made. The game was widely successful and has become a highly recognizable brand of the 1980s gaming era.",

It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles.\n\nThe game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead, instead of a first-person, perspective.

In Vietnam, Rambo has to fight animals in the jungles, swamps, and caves like wasps, snakes, fish, tigers, bats, spiders, birds, apes and flamingos. Before making his way to the POW camp he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing different color shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map requiring the player to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen. There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up that are knife, throwing knife, bow and arrow, bow and exploring arrow, gun, and hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There is also health vile that restores health as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password save that can be retrieved when talking to any person.",

    "summary": "Unlike Technos' subsequent game Double Dragon, the playing field is limited to one two-screen-wide area (a subway platform, a harbor, an alley, a parking lot and the hideout of a gang) and does not scroll continuously. Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks.\n\nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty.\n\nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack.\n\nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.",

There is no limit to how many vehicles a player can receive to complete a rally, as long as they have fuel. However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade, Genesis and Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off; however, the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally. For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as a bonus. Players can get fuel in four ways: green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point.",

    "summary": "RoboCop 2 is a series of video games published in the 1990s by Ocean and Data East for various home computers and video game consoles. They are based on the movie of the same name. Three different games were produced, each produced on two systems.\n\nThe version for the Commodore 64 and NES was a simple left-to-right scrolling platformer, in which RoboCop was required to collect/destroy at least two-thirds of the drug \"nuke\" in each level and arrest two-thirds of the suspects by running into them (in contrast to shooting them). If RoboCop does not manage to attain the required amounts of nuke or number of arrests then he has two chances in the game to prove his efficiency at a shooting range. If he succeeds, he may continue onto the next level. If he fails, or if both chances at the shooting range are already used up, he must repeat the level.\n\nThe version for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC was also a platform game, but one that offered movement in both directions (vertically and horizontally) as well as into various areas providing an element of exploration. There were also a number of puzzle sub-games that had to be completed to progress in the game.\n\nThe version for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST was similar in nature to the 8-bit Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions, but contained completely different levels to take advantage of the extra power offered by these computers.\n\nThere was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone). The game followed the basic premise of the movie, but had some major sequential differences.",

Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.\n\nEach level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.\n\nThe fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil demon that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father \"guides\" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the demon in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death.",

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.\n\nThe gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.\n\nA player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.",

    "summary": "Is nothing sacred? RollerGames™, the 21st Century's most popular thrill sport, is the latest victim of V.I.P.E.R. (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades). With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. \nYou and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles . . . through six stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous land-slides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. \nIf your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double whammy slams. \nIt's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames™. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball bearings into bullets.",

There are four stages: a Marshalling Area, a Harbor, an Air Base and a Siberian Camp. The omnipresent knife can be supplemented with captured arms. By killing certain enemy soldiers, the player can obtain a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. At the end of each stage, the player will face a unique group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs, Stage 3 with three shooting autogyros and Stage 4 with a skillful multi-shot flamethrower operator. When the mission is accomplished the four rescued POWs salute and the player restarts the game from the first stage on the next difficulty level. While the player can remain still in one area and rack up points, if he takes too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There's also an invisible time limit that will kill off the player if he takes too long to complete the stage.",

All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.",

You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.",

    "summary": "Exciting World War II Submarine Action in the South Pacific by Sid Meier.\n\n0400 hours, Tuesday 1942... BATTLE STATIONS!! BATTLE STATIONS!! Enemy convoy identified on radar!!\n\nSILENT SERVICE, The Submarine Simulation, brings exciting action, great strategy, detailed graphics and an ultra-realistic simulation of a World War II U.S. submarine in the South Pacific.\n\nSILENT SERVICE's outstanding features include: all the critical battle stations 0 engine room, conning tower and ship's bridge; challenging and realistic combat versus single ships and heavily escorted convoys; and an infinite variety of situations using complete maps and charts for the entire South-west Pacific and a sophisticated and realistic attack plotting system.\n\nSILENT SERVICE is the most detailed and realistic submarine simulation for home computers. Player selected \"reality levels\" allow the player to customize complexity, and time scaling ensures that the actions and decisions are constantly required. SILENT SERVICE provides a wide selection of historical scenarios from individual attacks to patrol missions that bring challenge and fun to both the first time player and the experienced submarine veteran. Will you, as submarine captain, select a quiet patrol sector in the Marianas Islands, or choose the dangerous waters off the coast of Japan? Is the submerged daylight periscope attack best, or do you charge in on the surface at night using only radar bearing to guide you? Do you pick off the enemy with a single torpedo shot? These decisions and many more are yours to make as you take your place among the elite ranks of the SILENT SERVICE!",

The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air. The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.",

Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.",
    "summary": "Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter \"F\" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter \"S\" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.",

Then blast into \"Mad Max on Wheels\", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally \"Skate and Destroy\", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards.

To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.\n\nYou can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.",

    "summary": "Sky Shark (released in Japan as \"Hi Sho Zame\", and in Europe as \"Flying Shark\")is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game in which players take control of the titular biplane through five increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, airplanes and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.\n\nIn April 2020, M2 announced a new version of Flying Shark as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label. It was first announced to be released on the Nintendo Switch.",

Grateful to this 'Rolla Radical, the Colonel has donated the biggest, baddest Ultra-Sheik Nuclear Attack Tank to his fellow madman's world dominating cause.\n\nNow your mission is to not only save Earth, but to inflict revenge. It's a job you'll definitely take personally as you infiltrate a nation of armed lunatics. Blow up a battleship. Hijack a train. Locate dozens of weapons and a truth serum that'll force enemy commanders to spill their guts. Then, destroy Vermon, Higharolla and the Earth Threatening Device with one lethal blow. All this, while staying in radio contact with a foxy spy named Jennifer and a Stealth copter pilot who'll be hovering nearby. So whaddaya think, Snake - are you commando enough to handle this Kockamamie scheme?",

    "summary": "Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy-filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon than the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.",

Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.",

    "summary": "Originating in the arcades, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.",

    "summary": "Stack-Up is a video game released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, designed for use with the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by collectors to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.",

As Captain Kirk, you'll control phasers, photon torpedoes, shields, and communications during eight separate space and ground missions. Visit different worlds and then join a landing party sent down to map and interact with alien races and artifacts.\n\nPiloting the U.S.S. Enterprise is a thrill in itself, but the actual voices of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols will make your adventure truly out of this world.",

Stylistically, the game is influenced by Super Sprint. \n \nThere are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game. \n \nThe car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will drop.",

    "storyline": "One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamt of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before spreading out as far as his eyes could see. When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint voice saying, \"Welcome to Subcon, the land of dreams. We have been cursed by Wart and we are completely under his evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please defeat Wart and return Subcon to its natural state. The curse Wart has put on you in the real world will not have any effect upon you here. Remember, Wart hates vegetables. Please help us!\"\n\nAt the same time this was heard, a bolt of lightning flashed before Mario’s eyes. Stunned, Mario lost his footing and tumbled upside down. He awoke with a start to find himself sitting up in his bed. To clear his head, Mario talked to Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach about the strange dream he had. They decided to go to a nearby mountain for a picnic.\n\nAfter arriving at the picnic area and looking at the scenery, they see a small cave nearby. When they enter this cave, to their great surprise, there’s a stairway leading up, up and up. It is exactly like the one Mario saw in his dream. They all walk together up the stairs and at the top, find a door just like the one in Mario’s dream. When Mario and his friends, in fear, open the door, to their surprise, the world that he saw in his dream spreads out before them!",

They set out for Yoshi’s Island in the magical island nation of Dinosaur Land far to the south.\n\nBut soon after arriving on the island, Princess Peach suddenly disappears. As Mario and Luigi desperately search for her, they discover a strange egg on the outskirts of the island. Then, before their very eyes, an odd little dragon hatches! The dragon calls himself Yoshi and says, \"Monstrous turtles recently appeared here in this Dinosaur Land. They have used magic to seal my friends inside eggs. I tried to help them, but the turtles are incredibly strong and cast a spell on me, too… Will you please come with me to rescue my friends?\"\n\nWhat can this mean? Apparently, Bowser hasn’t learned his lesson, so it appears that his minions have yet again kidnapped Princess Peach.\n\nMario and Luigi begin another adventure in hopes of rescuing Yoshi’s pals and Princess Peach!",

The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.",

However, Shere Khan wants to put Rebecca out of business, so he hires the Air Pirates, led by Don Karnage, to do his dirty work.\n\nIn the NES and Game Boy games, Baloo has to deliver his cargo across the world while fighting the pirates who are trying to stop him. Players control Baloo in his plane The Seaduck, except upon entry to a bonus level, where the player then controls Kit on his airfoil.",
    "summary": "TaleSpin is a scrolling shooter video game based on the Disney television series TaleSpin. The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.\n\nThe NES version of the game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.\n\nThe gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Sea Duck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.",

    "summary": "Target: Renegade is a scrolling beat'em up (or flip-screen on certain versions) computer game released on the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum systems in the late 1980s by Ocean Software on their \"Imagine\" label, as well as a Nintendo Entertainment System version published by Taito. The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels.\n\nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans.\n\nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.\n\nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.",

The player controls Gomez Addams as he explores the various rooms in the mansion, locating items and battling monsters, until he has located all of the lost family members. The game has an almost completely open-world format, unusual for games of this era, which gives players the freedom to choose what order they will save the family members in. However, Gomez cannot save Morticia until the rest of the family is rescued.",

To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads.\n\nThe main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.",

There’s even magic money which will have an extra lively effect you won’t want to miss. So get ready to get spooky, and get set to get kooky… it’s Pugsley’s Scavenger Hunt! En garde!",

The game is a platformer with a wacky storyline in which the eponymous main character explored multiple planets and fought enemies while jumping through levels. The game was notable for the planet Turvia, where gravity works in reverse. In that level the protagonist was drawn upside down, as were the enemies and the entire screen. The main character has a comically large head and strongly resembles actor Bruce Campbell. His early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.",

You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await. \n \nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game.

The action takes place in outer space from a side-scrolling perspective where the ship always remains lined up in the middle of the screen but is able to turn forwards and backwards while accelerating and decelerating. The ship can also collapse into a slimmer configuration. Enemies come at you from all directions and in all formations. Shoot them as quickly as possible while also disabling the enemy fleet's starcruisers as best you can.\n\nThe game also features a 2-player mode where each player takes turns fighting the armada.",

It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!",

And Buster faces the thrills and chills of the Funhouse.\nEach ride costs a certain amount of tickets, but as the player racks up points on the various rides, more tickets are earned. Eventually, when enough tickets have been earned, they can be saved until the player has enough to afford the entrance fee to the Funhouse, where Buster Bunny must then navigate numerous obstacles before squaring off with the \"Secret Admirer\", who turns out to be Montana Max.\nJust like in the first game, Roderick Rat is there to try to interfere, plus other villain characters.

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.",

Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks).

Only a second to react, you go to guns and arm missiles. Your heart pounds and palms sweat as you blast into the dogfight with cannons blazing. Tracers zip past your engines. Shells shatter your senses. Now it's just you against them. And to survive you'll need more than speed and firepower. You'll need guts and instinct. You'll need to be a \"TOP GUN\" pilot!",

Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc. to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation 'cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing'. However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.",
    "summary": "Based on the movie of the same name, Total Recall puts you in charge of Douglas Quaid, who must find a way to Mars in order to find the answers to his two questions: why is he being hunted, and who is hunting him. In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.\n\nSome of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.",

    "summary": "The arcade version can be played by up to two players alternating. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons. Similarly to Kung-Fu Master or Rush'n Attack, the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies and the other button is used to hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as throwing knives and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which will cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some point, allowing the player to recover their weapon. Other power-ups includes floating hearts that will restore the player's health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.\n\nThe game consist of six stages, where the player will face the usual series of small fry enemies, as well as a sub-boss at the middle of each stage and a boss at the end. The player is allowed to start the game at any of the six stages. However, the player must play through the entire game again after defeating the final boss, Achilles, in order to see the true ending (similarly to Ghosts'n Goblins). The player can continue after a game over depending on the dip switch settings.",

He takes with him the robot Beeper as proof of their discovery, and the mutual understanding between human and robot culture blossoms.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Gearus 9, an isolated Quine slips gently into madness, dominating the peaceful robots, and proclaiming himself Lord Q! Incapable of violence, the robots are easy prey for his schemes and hidden desires of conquest.\n\nWhen Sword and Beeper finally return to the planet, they are confronted by what Quine has become.

Toad, the Mushroom Kingdom hero, has decided to travel to Wario's Woods and put an end to Wario's evil reign of terror. Toad knows that, with the sprites help, he will be able to rid the forest of Mario's twisted nemesis. Thankfully, the sprites are able to create bombs. It's Toad's job to line up the bombs with the enemies of the woods, thus defeating those evil creatures. By clearing more and more of the woods, Toad steps ever close to the ultimate challenge of facing Wario.",

One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.",

Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.",

    "storyline": "An evil Witch queen called Bavmorda is after the holy baby of the lands, Elora Danan, intent on destroying her. A young peaceful wizard called Willow Ufgood was selected to protect Elora. Later on, a brave warrior named Madmartigan joins Willow to fight the enemy rival General Kael.",
    "summary": "The arcade version of the game belongs to the platform genre. It has six stages, some where Willow plays his part, others where Madmartigan plays his and one of the stages where either character is selectable. Move the joystick left or right to move in that direction. Press the A button to use a weapon. Hold down the A button and let go to fire stronger shots indicated on the magic power gauge. Press the B button to jump. While jumping press the B button and move the joystick up to haul up ledges. Press the B button and moving the joystick down the player can descend ledges or slide on other surfaces. Chests can be smashed open to reveal useful items. Collect gold for purchasing items at shops from the Owl Mage. Purchasable items include weapons, healing potions, defensive jewellery, a life pack, a 1-up and some information. Depending on whether the player is playing as Willow or Madmartigan determines if either the magic weapon or the blade weapon can be purchased. There are also sub-bosses in some stages. At the end of each stage, stage boss must be defeated to proceed.\n\nThe version of Willow released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Famicom is an adventure game in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. The game has the player taking on the role of Willow. Unlike the film and arcade game, Willow generally travels alone, only briefly meeting other characters. In the tradition of The Legend of Zelda, Willow wields a sword and shield and many supplementary items along with a wide variety of magic spells. As the game progresses and Willow defeats enemies, he gains experience points and levels as in a role-playing video game.",

    "storyline": "After the defeat of Werdna, Trebor sent his remaining army to clean out the rest of the maze. Upon extermination of every monster, Trebor decided to make certain that Werdna (who is aided by the dark arts) would never be able to return. Attempting to use the amulet much like Werdna did, Trebor was able to slightly alter the structure of the labyrinth below him. He ordered guards to forever patrol the passages of the dungeon to make sure that Werdna would not be able to return from the dead. So possessed did he become with the concept of Werdna's return, the overlord soon drove himself to the point of suicide. Rumors say that his ghost still walks the levels of the maze below the castle looking for Werdna. With Trebor dead, the power of the city was once again divided between the High Council and the Royal Family. Hailed as heroes, your party was offered one of the highest honors in the kingdom.\n\nIt's been about two years since the death of Trebor, and now another crisis has erupted.\n\nThe city of Llylgamyn had always been under the protection of a powerful artifact known as the Staff of Gnilda. The staff surrounded the city with a magic field that protected it from evil. Anyone who wished harmful intent for the city of Llylgamyn would find themselves unable to enter it's gates. While those who wished it no harm could come and go as they pleased. This seemed to provide the perfect defense, however there was a way around it. The staff could only stop evil from entering the city, but if evil was born inside the city walls, that person was unaffected by the staff.\n\nOf course it is known Werdna was native to the kingdom, but little did anyone know there was another dark soul born in the city walls. His name was Davalpus. Davalpus called upon the darkest of monsters; aided by the agents of evil he stormed the castle slew the royal family. Only Prince Alavik and his sister Princess Margda escaped. They knew there was only one hope of defeating Davalpus and that was with the staff itself. The Staff of Gnilda is located in the underground temple beneath the Royal Castle. It was placed there by a legendary hero known only as the Knight of Diamonds. In order to handle the staff a person must be dressed from head to toe in the armor of that legendary knight. The armor is scattered throughout the temple and is heavily guarded. Entering the temple undetected, The Prince was able to retrieve all of the armor, and eventually the staff as well.\n\nPrepared for battle, the Prince confronted Davalpus in an epic battle. As the Prince landed the killing blow, Davalpus uttered a curse so powerful that the castle was reduced to rubble leaving the Temple of Gnilda exposed. With a flash of light both the prince and the body of Davalpus were gone. The staff was gone as well. On that day the god Gnilda spoke to the people of the city: \"I have found this city unworthy of my protection and have hidden my staff within the depths of my temple. If the staff is sought out and returned to my main chamber, I will once again place the city under my protection. This is the word of Gnilda.\n\nNews of this event spread across the kingdom, the city was vulnerable without the staff to protect it. Who could be powerful enough to enter the temple and bring the staff back?\n\nThe High Council of sages have turned to you. They remember the deeds of your past and implore you to help the city once again. If you are successful you will be granted royal honors and riches beyond your imagination.\n\nYou have accepted.",

    "storyline": "The land of Llylgamyn is the basis of many legends. It is the center of commerce throughout the land, and home of the academy where some of the bravest warriors are trained. In it's early days it was a monarchy ruled by the royal family, but as time passed the power shifted to aristocrats and theocrats, and eventually the royal family became more symbolic then anything else.\n\nUnder a more democratic system, the High Council of Sages appointed an Overlord to govern over the kingdom. With that, the power of the royal family diminished almost completely. The Overlord was a former warrior of the realm, and a local hero. His name was Trebor. At first everything seemed well, but as time went by Trebor's thirst for power began to show. He began searching for ways to expand his rule. He learned of an ancient amulet held in a forgotten temple somewhere outside of the kingdom. Eventually, through unknown means he was able to find it's hidden location. He gathered his best men and sent them on a mission to retrieve this legendary artifact. They returned successful. Trebor, however, was not the only person who wanted this artifact. Only hours behind him in reaching it's original destination was the evil wizard Werdna (arch-enemy of Trebor). When Werdna discovered that someone had found the amulet before him he grew very angry. Using his magic he was able to discover it's new location. That evening the Wizard made his assault on Overlord's Castle. Making himself invisible he was able to sneak past Trebor's guards. He found the overlord sitting in his throne room with a group of sages studying the amulet. Werdna cast a powerful spell that made Trebor and everyone in his immediate vicinity frozen with fear. With Trebor unable to move, Werdna plucked the amulet right from his hands and left the castle.\n\nWerdna knew that once the Trebor regained his senses he would be prime suspect. He couldn't return to his tower, he needed a new hiding place. That's when he was struck with a brilliant idea. Werdna decided to use to amulet to make a new home right beneath the city of Llylgamyn! There was enough underground mining activity already, he should go unnoticed. Upon the thought of this very plan, the amulet began to glow. Suddenly there was tremendous earthquake, and in a flash Werdna found himself in a giant ten level labyrinth in the ground below the city. Summoning monsters to be his allies Werdna explored his way to the lowest depths and made a home where he would be able to study the powers of the amulet undisturbed.\n\nAfter losing the amulet and discovering the existence of the mysterious maze beneath his city, Trebor became unhinged. His madness grew daily, all he could think of was getting his amulet back. He called for the greatest warriors in the realm to enter the maze and find Werdna, but the monsters grew greater in numbers and they began to spread to even the highest depths of the maze.\n\nA year after the discovery of the maze, Trebor had managed to secure the first four floors. Most of the warriors who tried to journey deeper were never seen again, those that were returned with their minds warped, speaking of demons and dark magic. Trebor ordered the passages to the deeper layers of the maze to be magically sealed, thus preventing these creatures from making their way to the town. He also ordered that traps be set on the first three layers. Upon completion, Trebor declared the maze his own personal proving grounds. New cadets enrolled in the training academy would be offered the opportunity to brave the maze. Those that could find the secret he had hidden for them would be rewarded. Trebor decided he could use the maze as a test, those that would be able to able to make their way to the fourth floor would be deemed worthy and told the truth about Werdna and the amulet. They would be given the chance to go deeper into the maze. If they could return with the amulet, they would be inducted as members of Trebor's Personal Guard.\n\nIt has been five years since the disappearance of the amulet, and this time it is your characters that have volunteered to challenge the maze.\n\nThis is where it all begins.",
    "summary": "The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.",

Suddenly, a powerful bolt of magic has robbed Kuros of his armor, memory, and honor. But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives. Without his armor, Kuros will need crafty disguises to travel undetected, ready to do battle as a wizard, nobleman or thief. His quest will take him from the depths of the dungeon to the palace containing riches beyond belief - building strength, perfecting fighting skills and acquiring rare knowledge of magic along the way. The time has come for Kuros to turn his visions of power... into reality!",

The player can choose which power to use by pressing start. These powers can help the Black Manta defeat enemies and bosses more quickly. The Black Manta can save kidnapped children hidden throughout each level, however, it plays no role in completing the game and does not warrant any kind of special bonus.\n\nPart of the last level is seen through a first person perspective. Towards the end of this stage, the Black Manta has to defeat one of the bosses from the previous levels before he goes face-to-face with El Toro himself.",

    "storyline": "Several years after the events of The Legend of Zelda, just before his sixteenth birthday, Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, similar to that of the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who responds by taking Link to the tower of North Castle, where a maiden lies in a deep sleep. Impa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda, a princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the \"Legend of Zelda\". A long time ago the Prince of Hyrule had tried to obtain the Triforce, but Zelda refused to tell him the location of it. In order to extract the information from her, he brought in a Magician to interrogate her. Unable to find out any information, the wizard cast a sleeping spell on her, which also resulted in his own death. The prince, being unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened. He decreed that all females born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.\n\nImpa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the chosen hero to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings indicating that each crystal needs to be placed in a different palace in Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage, which has the power to awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon's ashes would supposedly resurrect their master.\n\nUltimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces, and with the crystals in place, the entrance to the Great Palace is opened. After venturing deep inside, Link is made to battle and defeat a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link. After Dark Link is defeated, Link claims the Triforce and uses it to awaken Zelda, who embraces Link while a curtain falls in front of them.",
    "summary": "The land of Hyrule is in chaos. As Link, you’ll be sent on a treacherous journey to return six precious crystals to their origins in six stone statues. Only by defeating the guardians of the six palaces will you gain passage to the seventh palace, take on the ultimate challenge that awaits you, and wake the Princess Zelda from her sleeping spell. On your way, helpful villagers you encounter will offer clues and secret messages invaluable in your quest. As you guide Link through the levels of Hyrule, close-ups and overviews will enhance your video vision. Are you up to the challenge?",

But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies. \n \nBut wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown! \n \nThere are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth. \n \nFinally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth. \n \nFor 1 Ninja Master.",
