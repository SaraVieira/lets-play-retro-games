While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.\n\nA level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points.\n\nEvery once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted.\n\nWhen the entire maze is painted you win the level.

While the Japanese version is somewhat common, the English version is not.\n\nThis game is essentially a port of its three dimensional counterpart for the Dreamcast. To accommodate downscaling for the Neo Geo handheld, the 3D graphics of the original were replaced with top-down two-dimensional maps and 2-D sprites.\n\nBoth the Japanese and UK version of the game were released in hard plastic boxes rather than soft cardstock.\n\nThe English translation has frequent grammar and spelling errors.",

It was ported to both the Sharp X68000 and the NEC TurboGrafx-CD in 1993. The TurboGrafx-CD version was released on Super CD-ROM and features an enhanced redbook audio soundtrack and voice acting on the Japanese release. The game was later ported to Sony PlayStation under the title Cotton Original in 1999. The PlayStation release combines the enhanced digital CD-ROM soundtrack of TurboGrafx-CD release and the gameplay/graphics of the original Arcade version. A version was ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000. Due to hardware limitations the Neo Geo Pocket Color features less detailed graphics and sound compared to previous versions, however it is still a faithful version of the original in terms of gameplay.",

Heavily story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.\n\nBattles are part turn based and part real-time. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in real-time for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.",

The only exception is that that the battlefield consists of six columns instead of seven, akin to the Super Famicom ports of the first two Magical Drop games.\n\nThe game features Story, Self Challenge and Friend Challenge; these correspond to the standard 1P VS Com, Solo, and 2P VS modes featured in other Magical Drop games. Story features five difficulty modes while Self Challenge features three.\n\nLike many other handheld puzzle games of the time, Story does not feature a \"true\" AI opponent; instead, the player attempts to fill a gauge by creating chains. While the player attempts to fill this gauge, the AI attacks at random intervals.",

This is also one of the first two titles by Nazca, the other being the popular Metal Slug before & between being acquired by SNK.\n\nThe game is a fast paced, arcade-style golf game. Players choose from two game modes, stroke play for one or two players, and match play for two players only.\n\nCompeting on one of four fictional golf courses located in the United States, Japan, Australia and Germany, players choose from one of six players with different attributes:\n\n\"Young Hero\" (George Spinner, USA)\n\"Technician\" (Thomas Stewart, United Kingdom)\n\"Veteran\" (Frank Adams, Australia)\n\"Shot Maker\" (Robert Landolt, Germany)\n\"Power Golfer\" (Fernando Almeida, Brazil)\n\"Putt Master\" (Toyoshige Takeno, Japan)\n\nUnlike many golf games of the era which used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, Neo Turf Masters uses a single click for the power of the shot, and a second for the height of the shot; hook and slice are selected with buttons B and C before making the shot. This makes the game much easier to pick up and play well than its contemporaries, but it compensates for this reduced difficulty with fiendish (if somewhat unrealistic) course layouts and highly variable wind.",

New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve. \n \nThere are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.",

The battles are fought linearly in any order, and after each boss is defeated, a special weapon is added to the player's arsenal. Each boss is weak to one specific weapon, so the player is encouraged to strategize the order in which the bosses are faced. Two players can use a link cable to transfer database information between systems, but no co-op or versus play is supported.",

    "summary": "Super Real Mahjong Premium Collection is the first handheld installment in the Super Real Mahjong series. As usual, you play strip mahjong with pretty girls, this time several from many of the games. However, due to the system's limitations, only a few strip scenes are animated. It also has some visual novel-like qualities, particularly a story mode where you try to focus on one girl each time it is played. This is accomplished by choosing the right options when they are presented to you. If you succeed in focusing on only one girl, her CG is then unlocked in the gallery.",
