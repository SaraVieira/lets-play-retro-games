The story picks up shortly after the events of the previous game. After his showdown with the Scientist and the Android, Tetsujin finds himself disembodied. A mysterious corporation known as SCR gives you a new body, but their plans for your are mysterious.\n\nThe format of this game is mostly similar to the first. This is a first person shooter that relies heavily on video cutscenes to tell a story. The graphics engine has been improved greatly, giving this game a much faster pace than it's predecessor. Whereas the original used a combination of live actors and CG, this one uses CG to depict the humans as well.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-angel-of-the-apocalypse-the-return"}
