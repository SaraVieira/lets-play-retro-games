Don't even think of looking for an official--in this game, it's jam-or-be-jammed--and great D leaves the opposition gasping. In Intensive Care. \n \nStep onto one of the five stylin' courts, and the air show begins. Revers jams. Fade-away jumpers. And way more attitude--and altitude--than you'll ever find in the so-called pros. \n \nGet past our three asphalt warriors, and we'll send you to meet the Judge, and you'd better bring your license to drive. Put some money down, talk a little trash, then walk the walk. Or else you'll watch yourself getting faced on our exclusive Slam Cam... \n \nThese guys don't even know how to spell \"foul.\" \n \nMastered one on one? There are six more game variations out there, chump. \n \nWhen you go to the hoop, the Slam Cam zooms in on the action. \nReasons to lay down the cash: \n \n-\"The Slam Cam\"--get up-close-and-impersonal as players drive the lane \n-Over 700 frames of digitized animation \n-Five graffiti covered basketball courts \n-Side bets, 'cause only money really talks \n-Enough digitized trash talk to dis the entire neighborhood \n-Seven different streetball games: Sweat, 1-on-1, 2 Hot, Poison, Slams Only, in-2-it and Frenzy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jammit"}
