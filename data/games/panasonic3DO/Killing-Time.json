The ancient \"Water-Clock of Thoth\" had been discovered by his professor of Egyptology, Dr. Hargrove, but the artifact went missing soon after a visit by the expedition's patron, Tess Conway. Tess is the rich inheritor of her family's estate on Matinicus Isle, where she keeps her friends, and pawns close by so that she might gain the true power of the Water-Clock. As the game progresses, the player finds out that Tess, has used a number of people to gain what she desires, but at a price. Something went horribly wrong, transforming everyone on the entire isle into either restless ghosts, demons or the undead. In the opening cinematic on all versions of the game, Boldt Castle located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the Saint Lawrence River is used as the visual representation of the Conway Estate.","summary":"A sophisticated shooter laced with gallows humor. Killing Time is no shallow grave. Its depth is well-conceived. Puzzle solving and strategic thinking are placed at a premium.","total_rating":77.7495929157352,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/killing-time","videos":[{"id":79444,"game":4334,"video_id":"nxydZFKhSfE","checksum":"d276c9f0-0e50-55e2-46f3-9a8e9cf4e669"}]}
