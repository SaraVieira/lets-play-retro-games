There are 25 levels in all, each with a challenging array of horrific aliens to destroy, switch puzzles to solve, and platforming elements. Ox can either walk throughout the levels or utilize an ultra-powerful jetpack; use the latter in moderation as it's an important, yet limited tool.","total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/po-ed"}
