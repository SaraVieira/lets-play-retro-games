In a surprise attack, the aliens decimate Earth's military forces. Mankind's only hope is the surviving orbital space carrier Omaha and its squadron of F-177 pilots. As the young and unexperienced member of the squadron, it is your job to drive the aliens from the planet. \n \nFrom the cockpit of your F-177 fighter, you can destroy the aliens who attack in vehicles like large walkers or quick and small aircraft. Use your lasers or missiles, but watch your ammunition and fuel and refill them from a supply depot if needed. The ten missions take you all over the globe, from Cairo to Los Angeles to the Congo. Between missions, live-action cutscenes continue the story.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shock-wave"}
