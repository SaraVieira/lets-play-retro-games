Fairly simple in design, it features a video background with which you interact - you use your mouse or a light gun to literally shoot your foes and protect the innocent.\n\nThe story is this: you're a bounty hunter, one of the last, who come to a crime-infested Wild Western town to aid its Sheriff in getting rid of the criminals.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-bounty-hunter"}
