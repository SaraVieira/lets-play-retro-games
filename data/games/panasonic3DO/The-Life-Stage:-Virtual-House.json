Players build the basic structure of connected rooms and placement of doors, then drop in decorations and select textures for floors and wallpapers. Players can then roam around their virtual homes and interact with some of the objects within.\n\nThe game comes preset with some demo floorplans, ranging from a house in the snowy mountains, to an office building downtown. Only one room is held in the system's limited memory at a time, so players must \"use\" doors to move to a new room. After a lengthy load time, the player will be standing in the new room. There are limits on the size and complexity of individual rooms as well.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-life-stage-virtual-house--1"}
