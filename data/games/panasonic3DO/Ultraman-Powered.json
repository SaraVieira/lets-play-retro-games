Some of them looks like giant dinosaurs and the others are too odd to describe. This title is a one-on-one fighting game. The player has the option to fight in versus mode or story mode. Also, a two-player mode is included, to battle against human opponents.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultraman-powered"}
