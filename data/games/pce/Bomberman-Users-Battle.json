It bears a 1990 copyright, just like the original release of Bomberman for the platform. Additionally, it plays the same title screen music upon boot, but it has a different title screen, only allowing for multiplayer play for two to five players. It lacks the skull mode option of the full Bomberman release, but otherwise shows similar menus and styles to Bomberman's multiplayer mode. \n \nIt is believed that Users Battle was created in extremely limited quantities for use at tournaments, demo kiosks, or both. Some online sources estimate the number of cards produced at around 1,000.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-users-battle"}
