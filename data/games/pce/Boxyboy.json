Gameplay is simple: the goal of each level is to push the crates onto specific squares marked with a yellow dot. It's very easy to get boxes trapped, so the player must carefully consider the route.\n\nBoxyboy also features a level editor for players to create and play their own levels.\n\nIn Japan, Boxyboy is known as Sokoban World and is an official part of the Sokoban series.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/boxyboy"}
