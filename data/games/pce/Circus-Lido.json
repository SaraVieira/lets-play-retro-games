The tongue can be used to capture enemies and spit them out towards the Venus flytraps, which are the only way to remove them from the stage. The tail can be used to climb vines scattered around, which allows the chameleon to ascend through the stage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/circus-lido"}
