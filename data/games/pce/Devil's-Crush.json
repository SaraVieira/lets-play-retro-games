The second installment in the Crush Pinball series after Alien Crush, the game has an eerie occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. It was later followed by Jaki Crush and Alien Crush Returns.\n\nThe game was ported to the Sega Mega Drive, retitled Dragon's Fury (Devil Crash MD in Japan) which was developed by Technosoft. Devil's Crush was later released on the Wii's Virtual Console, with the European release reverting to its original title; however, the pentagram symbols were removed and replaced with 8-sided star.","total_rating":76,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/devil-s-crush"}
