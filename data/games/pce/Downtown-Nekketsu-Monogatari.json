Within a few months, the brothers take control of the neighboring high schools using powerful fighting techniques, striking fear as the \"Double Dragon Brothers\". Riki, the banchou of Hanazono High School has no interest in the brothers or what they have been doing. But one day his girlfriend Mami goes missing and he receives a challenge from the academy. Enraged, Riki decides to make his way to the academy alone, but finds Kunio waiting for him outside his school. Kunio wants to help Riki rescue his girlfriend and he begrudgingly agrees.","summary":"The PC Engine Super CD-ROM version of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari (known as River City Ransom in North America, Street Gangs in Europe), released on December 24, 1993, was published by Naxat Soft and developed by KID, the same team that did the PC Engine versions of Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball (Super Dodge Ball), Double Dragon II: The Revenge, and Downtown Nekketsu Koushinkyoku.\n\nThis version features enhanced graphics, an arranged redbook soundtrack and fully voiced characters, with the voices of Kunio and Riki performed by Ryou Horikawa and Nobutoshi Canna respectively.
