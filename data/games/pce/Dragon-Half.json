You progress around a board by rolling a dice, competing against other human or computer controlled players. Landing on different coloured squares has different effects. Some of these cause special events, others trigger animated battle sequences that require precisely timed button pushes for maximum impact.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-half"}
