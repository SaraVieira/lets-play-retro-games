Two young pilots were in the midst of a battle, and one of them, a lovely young woman, was killed. Three years later, the surviving pilot finally got a chance to avenge her death. Navigating a powerful new fighter ship named \"Slasher\", the pilot ventured into space, ready to bring destruction to those who took so much away from him.","summary":"Nexzr is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up similar to Super Star Soldier. The player-controlled spaceship starts with a simple vulcan gun that can only shoot straight. Various power-ups can either enhance the strength of this gun, replace it with a laser weapon, or add a secondary weapon (homing fire, thin spreading laser attacks, etc.), which is activated automatically. Mid- and end-level bosses are encountered on nearly every stage. Additional lives can be collected, but the player always restarts from the beginning of the stage when his fighter craft is destroyed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nexzr","videos":[{"id":18617,"game":42016,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"nVWJ5O-5qCQ","checksum":"b1c2afd1-0d0a-cdcc-8b02-fb69c3bf5941"}]}
