Later that year, Sting Entertainment, the creator of the original Data East game, developed and self-published a version for the X68000 released as Last Battalion.\n\nIt is the first recorded game developed by Sting Entertainment and the X68000 version is now available as a free \"one stage only\" demo download on Sting's website. On September 4, 2007, G-Mode published the Override version of the game for the Wii Virtual Console which (like its 1991 release) was reserved exclusively for the Japanese market.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/override--1"}
