It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters.\nThis game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius-da-shinwa-kara-owarai-he--1"}
