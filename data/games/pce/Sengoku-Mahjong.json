It was the first mahjong game released on the PC Engine and has since been rereleased on Wii Virtual Console and PSN.\n\nThe game features Single mode and Conquest Mode. In single mode you play a single mahjong game against the game cast. In conquest mode you play as a prefecture and try to conquer the entirety of Japan by winning on Mahjong.\n\nThe game only features 4-Player mahjong and can only be played against the computer. There is no password feature for the conquest mode, so it needs to be beaten in a single sitting.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sengoku-mahjong","videos":[{"id":37978,"game":43202,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"KOLFx-5yMVA","checksum":"31e9d046-e2c2-e185-be03-1d61608a96f7"}]}
