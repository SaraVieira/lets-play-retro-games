A message from the professor to return to their bodies has them head to his laboratory, but they are ambushed by a mysterious enemy along the way. After narrowly defeating the enemy, they catch a TV news flash announcing the Ryo Empire invasion. They find that the professor has been abducted and set out to rescue him.\n\nShockman is a side-view action shooter that has eight stages, including Action Stages, where you jump and use special techniques, and side-scrolling Shooting Stages. This game expands on the well-paced story from the previous version and contains cooperative elements like shared life and a powerful Team Shockbeam that can be used during two-player simultaneous play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shockman","videos":[{"id":36550,"game":42098,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"hh068Sj-Ems","checksum":"9cc45f4f-1f39-5c94-33af-f1b3f22ae855"}]}
