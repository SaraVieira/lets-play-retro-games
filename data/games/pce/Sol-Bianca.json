In 24th century, piracy is still an issue, but no more in seas and oceans, sailing ordinary ships - the pirates are in space! The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help. \n \nThe gameplay of Sol Bianca is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics. The party of heroines visits planets, travels on the world map, and engages randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sol-bianca"}
