Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.\nFor generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist of eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.","summary":"Turrican is a 1990 video game programmed and designed by Manfred Trenz. It was first developed for the Commodore 64 by Rainbow Arts, but was ported to other systems later. In addition to concept design and character creation, Trenz personally programmed Turrican on the Commodore 64. A sequel, Turrican II, followed 1991 for the Commodore 64 and other platforms.","total_rating":84.4840607329629,"total_rating_count":19,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/turrican","videos":[{"id":1974,"game":5164,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"HGxMDxGJXuo","checksum":"e8ea4d42-824c-7fc6-bdb3-27b16c3ba9e9"},{"id":40613,"game":5164,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"70xp5mnsx1A","checksum":"690f8a57-2471-556d-e9a9-83fab1b9498c"}]}
