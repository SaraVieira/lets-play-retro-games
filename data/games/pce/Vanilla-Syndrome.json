There, he is greeted by a cute bunny-eared girl named Vanilla (perhaps it should have been Bunnyla, but we'll never know), who says she is the guardian of the portal, and if he wants to return home, he'll have to defeat her and the other guardians in the game of mahjong!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mahjong-vanilla-syndrome"}
