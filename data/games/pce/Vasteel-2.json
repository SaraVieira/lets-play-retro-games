Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.","summary":"The sequel to the epic mecha war strategy title Vasteel. The sequel is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur. The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vasteel-2","videos":[{"id":68093,"game":54921,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"pRjhCVEWch0","checksum":"e4b950d4-60e8-adaf-7bfd-ee00358ceec6"},{"id":68094,"game":54921,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"rAJz5_qgokY","checksum":"93656e10-5e92-5152-953a-7158a3f0b430"}]}
