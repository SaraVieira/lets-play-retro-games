    "summary": "The prequel to 1942, like the other games in the 19XX series, is a top down shooter set in WWII.\n\nOne or two players control a P-38 (for player 1) or a Mosquito (for player 2), shooting enemy airplanes and ships. As in the previous games, one button shoots the airplane's weapon (which is upgradeable by collecting power ups left by enemies) and the other makes the airplane loop, destroying everything on screen (or causing extra damage to bosses, fought at the end of each level). The regular ammo is infinite, while the upgraded weapons have limited ammo. When the weapon button is held down, a bar at the bottom of the screen is charged and a special shot can be released, which varies in effect from weapon to weapon.\n\nThe airplane has a life bar which starts with three points. Each hit taken or loop used will consume one life point. The player will earn new life points at the end of levels or by collecting proper power ups. Other power ups available are auxiliary side and ghost airplanes. Three continues can be used, and one point is added to the score when one of them is used (a feature first introduced by this game and then copied by other shoot-em-ups).",

    "summary": "Developed and released alongside the Family Computer version, 1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen is an arcade game, an \"alternate\" version of the original 1943, released in 1987[3] only in Japan. Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828. \n \nIn 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music. \n \nThe game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end. \n \nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon. \n \nThere are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.",

    "summary": "Based on the Addams Family movie, the TurboGrafx-16 CD version is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...\n\nLike most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a \"hub\" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.",

Now they threaten to obliterate all organic life forms on the planet's surface...\nBut one man, Charles K. Takeda, has not given up hope.\nAs if he had known this day was coming, Takeda and a few of his friends had moved to a secluded insland in the Atlantic Ocean. Bringing with them only a few necessities, their mission was to develop one of Takeda's greatest inventions, the \"Blaster System\". This Blaster System would enable its pilot to freely manipulate the building blocks of matter by amplifying the distinctive brain waves humans generate. This would make it possible for humans to transcend reality by transforming matter and destroying space.\nAt present, two super machines, Blaster 1 and Blaster 2, have been completedand fitted with Blaster Systems. Takeda's son and daughter, Mike and Holly, have been specially trained to fly the Blaster Machines. Their mission is to defeat the M.L.M and to ultimately assist their father in building the ultimate aircraft carrier, \"Blaster Base.\"\nThe struggle is about to begin.\nThe two machines blast off, propelled by hopes and dreams, seeking peace through the avenue of war...",
    "summary": "Aero Blasters: Trouble Specialty Raid Unit is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Kaneko and licensed to Namco. The game was originally released in the arcades in 1990 and was subsequently released for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (as Aero Blasters) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (as Air Buster in North America) in 1990 and 1991 respectively.\n\nIn Aero Blasters, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Aero Blasters had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time; all games in the Thunder Force, Gradius, and R-Type series were only 1 player on the home consoles.",

The game has a unique option-based combat and features levels with large scaling effects or parallax scrolling effects.\n\nNearing the year 2020, the societies of mankind fall into global depression just as an alien invasion suddenly comes down on Earth; coming from a large mechanical planetoid, the aliens attack the Earth without reason or communication. With all defenses annihilated, the United Nations corresponds with NASA to make a powerful space fighter known as The Ortega under project name Aldynes. During that time, a particular space fighter pilot - known only by his call sign Fox-A - was killed in action; his bereaved girlfriend Hiroko soon discovered Project Aldynes and its near complete fighter. As the invaders attack the air force housing Project Aldynes, she hijacks one of the ships and throws herself into battle in hopes of getting her revenge.",

    "summary": "A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.",

    "summary": "Based on a TV anime series (from the grandfather of manga Osamu Tezuka), Blue Blink is a cute platformer that manages to find its place among the crowd. The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case. \n \nControl of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.",

First up is the choice between action and simulation mode. The main difference that I can make out between the two is that in action mode you have to both aim the shot and set the power, in simulation only the shot aiming is required. Your game is played out in two teams, rather than two individuals, and the members of your team are chosen from a variety of weird and crazy looking characters with varying attributes. Shots are aimed in a simple overhead viewpoint, which then switches to a standard view for the execution of the shot itself. All this is accompanied by a jolly little tune that plays away in the background.",

The control method takes a little getting used to - pressing button I selects from one of four weapons collected along the way, whereas holding down button I will lock you to the direction you are facing, making backing-away and firing easier. It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it. \n \nThe four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.",

Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.",

    "summary": "In the distant future, human beings invented space warps, which allowed space travel to long distances. On board the space ship Agamemnon, they started an intergalactic journey. But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...\n\nBabel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.",

Also to consider is the gubbins that make up your bike, such as tyres, engine, brakes etc as these have an effect depending on the type of course and the weather conditions.

Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.\n\nThough Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.\n\nMost battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.\n\nThe game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.",

The puzzle-based action in Lode Runner is simple: You are presented with a side-view platforms-and-ladders based level and you have to collect all the gold and escape without getting caught by the baddies. To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped. If you time it right, the hole will re-fill before the enemy can climb out, forcing them to respawn elsewhere in the level. If you prefer evasive action, make sure the coast is clear so you can escape up a ladder or across a well-placed rope, but be warned - they will follow! Once you have collected all the gold, hotfoot it to the nearest long ladder and escape out the top of the screen. In magazine previews, this was originally titled Lode Runner II.",

Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.\n\nThe weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Black Hole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.\n\nThe game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.",

One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...\n\nBlood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard \"RPG-like\" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures.\n\nThe player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.",

It bears a 1990 copyright, just like the original release of Bomberman for the platform. Additionally, it plays the same title screen music upon boot, but it has a different title screen, only allowing for multiplayer play for two to five players. It lacks the skull mode option of the full Bomberman release, but otherwise shows similar menus and styles to Bomberman's multiplayer mode. \n \nIt is believed that Users Battle was created in extremely limited quantities for use at tournaments, demo kiosks, or both. Some online sources estimate the number of cards produced at around 1,000.",

    "summary": "In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\n\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\n\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.",

A group of evil eyes have stolen parts of the Sunheart, and the player needs to recover them. \n \nBouken Danshaku Don: The Lost Sunheart (\"Adventures of Don Baron: The Lost Sunheart\", roughly) is a horizontal shoot 'em up exclusive to the PC Engine. The game's plot concerns the titular Sunheart device, which is broken into several pieces and spirited away by a group of malicious eyeball enemies. The hero, in a series of vehicles, takes down each of the boss creatures that are protecting a piece of the stolen Sunheart. \n \nThe game is distinct among shoot 'em ups for allowing players to keep their power-ups after dying. This does not mitigate the game's difficulty, as it has some very strict checkpointing and many enemies with difficult-to-avoid homing shots. The game's surreal sense of humor comes through with its bizarre bosses, in some way invoking the flamboyant Cho Aniki series.",

The village of Nitta consists of 22 stages -- action stages that take place on the ground and shooting stages that take place underwater. Action stages use a unique control system in which the height of a jump and the distance of an attack changes depending on how long players hold down the button. Players collect the Luck Symbols that appear when they defeat enemies and give them to Lottery Man to get recovery and power-up items.

Breed Schuyler and his heavy mechanical armor, codenamed \"X-BR Browning\" (The \"BROWN INnovation Gunner\"), are deployed to counter the impending threat. The operation \"Running Saber\" is a go - the machine and its pilot must both infiltrate the Sea-Square island, a man-made fortress that sits somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, and destroy the enemy's secret weapon. The game consists of five long stages which have to be completed within a time limit, from the island surface to the enemy's underground military and research facility. The Browning comes equipped with a Vulcan gun and the mecha-suit can hover for a short period of time. A force field also protects the armor against enemy attacks and the device automatically recharges itself whenever the energy balance is low and as long as it hasn't reach zero. The game features infinite continues and the player is sent back to the beginning of a stage when the Browning receives a deadly blow.

The player is given a selection of commands that they can use to interact with the world, including talking to NPCs, picking up and using objects in their inventory and moving to other areas. At any time the player can look and listen for extra context clues. The commands are in English, but the game's story and dialogue text is entirely Japanese. The game will occasionally switch protagonists, starting with Nene Romanova and moving to Priss, Linna and Sylia at various points.",

The stages contain a different layout of blocks, some that disappear after being shot, others that do not, and still others that are hidden and can reveal bonuses.\n\nThe stages start with differing numbers and sizes of balloons. The largest balloon divides for the first three times it is popped; after the fourth and smallest balloon is popped it vanishes. Each player starts with a single harpoon. When a balloon is popped, special weapons may drop down.\n\nAt a certain point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several thousand bonus points.\n\nIf a player touches a balloon of any size, the player dies and both players must start the stage again.\n\nWhen both players touch a balloon at the same time, only Player 1 will lose a life but this is somewhat offset because when both players reach a bonus or weapon simultaneously only Player 1 will get it.\n\nPlayers start with 3-5 lives depending on the dip switch setting. Extra lives are also given when certain point totals have been accumulated. The stage ends when all of the balloons are successfully cleared. The game ends after all stages have been completed and our heroic duo ride their jeep into the sunset on an Easter Island beach.\n\nIn some later versions, there are more than 17 locations.",

    "slug": "cadash",
    "storyline": "The game setting is a medieval fantasy world similar to that of the high fantasy seen in The Lord of the Rings. The demons and abominations of nature who reside in the underground kingdom of Cadash have not forgotten that, thousands of years previously, they once shared the light with humans. Then one rose among them who was especially powerful, a demonic wizard born of a human woman – the Balrog (Baarogue or Baalogue in the arcade version, and Barlog in the TurboGrafx version). The Balrog promised his followers they could, in time, emerge from their subterranean prison and rule the world of men, taking revenge on humans for their prior defeat in battle and subsequent exile, if the Balrog could mingle his blood with that of a human king. The Balrog and his demonic armies gathered in force over the centuries, and are now powerful enough to emerge to the surface and make war with the unprepared human kingdoms which had not known war for millennia, all of which quickly fall to the Balrog. The human world is almost entirely laid to waste by the Balrog. However, this was not enough for the Balrog, whose prize is the mightiest of all human kingdoms, the Kingdom of Dirzir. One night, the beautiful Princess Salassa is kidnapped by the Balrog from the Keep of Deerzar, the capital city of Dirzir, and taken underground to the dreaded Castle Cadash. There the Balrog plans to initiate the ritual which would magically bind himself to the human princess, becoming all-powerful and invincible. Dilsarl, the distraught and helpless elderly King of Dirzir, has vowed to give his entire kingdom to the one who would rescue his beloved only daughter, and many brave heroes have disappeared into the depths of Cadash on this quest.",
    "summary": "Cadash is an early example of what would become a fairly common trend in Japanese-made arcade games of the early 1990s: the \"platform-RPG\". Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link's gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.\n\nFour characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.\n\nThere are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash. The environments differ significantly, from pleasant meadows to caves, and from forests to underwater environments. Some foes encountered in these levels are derived from common mythology while others are completely made up for the game.",

    "summary": "At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.\n\nThe game includes five levels. As both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are just 60 seconds, the game is very short - a player who is able to finish the game on one credit will enjoy at most ten minutes of game-play.\n\nInterestingly enough when Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio the frequency is always 144.X (various)Mhz. This is actually the 2-meter band of amateur or ham radio frequencies.\n\nAlthough superficially similar in technology to Sega's Outrun, Chase HQ features significant technical advancements over that title in the presentation of perspective, hills and track splits.",

    "summary": "Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams is a scrolling shooter arcade game, released on Sega's Sega System 16B Arcade system board in 1989. It is the first in the Cotton series of videogames. It was ported to both the Sharp X68000 and the NEC TurboGrafx-CD in 1993. The TurboGrafx-CD version was released on Super CD-ROM and features an enhanced redbook audio soundtrack and voice acting on the Japanese release. The game was later ported to Sony PlayStation under the title Cotton Original in 1999. The PlayStation release combines the enhanced digital CD-ROM soundtrack of TurboGrafx-CD release and the gameplay/graphics of the original Arcade version. A version was ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000. Due to hardware limitations the Neo Geo Pocket Color features less detailed graphics and sound compared to previous versions, however it is still a faithful version of the original in terms of gameplay.",

The basic idea is traditional: shooting everything before they can shoot/touch the player: after three hits the chitin armor breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb. \n \nThe player has the choice between four insect forms which are changed by collecting the associated extra symbols. Collecting more of the same symbol upgrades the insect, but this also rises the difficulty level. Other extras include smart bombs, extra lives, armor refreshments or a protection shield. The game features the possibility to turn on rapid fire or to slow down the speed as well as big boss enemies at the end and within the levels.",

In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.\n\nCyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\n\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.",

It uses a real-time strategy format where players explore the island and plant various crops. They must also fight off the occasional monster attack from the nearby volcanos, and clear the resulting toxic ash away. \n \nThe game is thought to be derived from an educational kid's TV show about agriculture shown in the Hokkaido region. Fans have observed the similarity of Daichikun's family and companions and those featured in the TV show, and the similar theme of farming in a harsh climate. \n \nGameplay: \nThe player controls the oldest son of the family, the titular Daichikun, and his family members Hokkaido (grandpa), Suzuran (mama), Oozora (little brother), Marimo (little sister) and their friends Goro the bear and Alice the crow are all AI controlled and will follow the player until they find themselves a task to complete. Daichikun can use the flying \"Geiger No\" vehicle to move around and clear ash away quickly, though it cannot attack. \n \nAdditional factors unlock as the player progresses with the game, like a port town and various power-ups. The game is on a fast seasonal cycle - a minute represents a month - and various crops do better (or worse) depending on the time of the year.",

General Giovanni of the Gorongo military was infuriated with the results of the war and what it meant to the country of Gorongo, initiating a rebellion against the country’s government that was widely followed by his soldiers. Holing themselves up on Bobo Island, south of Gorongo, Giovanni declared the occupation as the independent state of Fuangania and plotted to take over Gorongo. After taking over the town of Kusunoki, the Fuangania invasion – consisting of massive ground and sea attack forces – started to spread.\n\nGorongo President Bratt ordered a counterattack that focused on the one type of firepower Giovanni lacked: an air force. The special air force \"Daisenpuu\" sets up a mountain base after spotting a secret Fuangania fortress under construction. However, nearing the end of their training, the airforce is spotted by the Fuangania and are preparing to attack. It's up to the player, in the role of the Wing Commander, to fly into Giovanni's secret base and take him and his commanding unit out.",
    "summary": "Twin Hawk is a 1989 vertically scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Toaplan and published by Taito. Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan's earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.\n\nAnother draw of Twin Hawk is the game's unique \"smartbomb\" in the form of a group of friendly planes; pressing button 2 once will call in six Flying Fortresses to surround and protect the player's plane, and provide back-up fire. They are easily taken down by enemy fire, so the player must use them wisely.\n\nPressing button 2 again immediately after the call-in will sacrifice the planes for a more typical smartbomb. Otherwise, pressing button 2 while any other plane is on-screen will suicide them all into the nearest enemies below.",

It was a mail-order exclusive, obtainable by sending in a pair of coupons found in the manuals of Super Darius and Darius Plus. There were only 800 copies of the card produced, making it one of the rarest, and the absolute most expensive, PC Engine HuCard ever made.

    "summary": "NOTE: \"Darius Plus\" is the TurboGrafx-16 PC-Engine port of the original Darius produced by Bits Laboratory and NEC Avenue. This is a different port than the title \"Darius+\", which was published by The Edge and developed by Softek for the Amiga, Atart ST, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nAmidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:\n- Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\n- Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\n- Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.",

After Nobita's mother burned all of his books, Doraemon and the others must find another way to save Shizuka.",

You have to rescue your friends who have dived into various books and are pursued by the inhabitants within. You start off having to avoid the wandering beasties, but eventually get hold of such items as a gun that freezes anything in your path for a moment. Along the way you get to ride on dinosaurs, crawl under moving stone blocks, creep along precarious ledges and slide down water chutes.",

    "summary": "Technōs created once again a vastly different experience with Double Dragon II on the NES. The experience system was dropped, but the moveset still underwent a few changes. The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.\n\nThe PC Engine CD version by Naxat Soft is surprisingly modeled closely after the NES game, from featuring mostly the same levels down to the rule of having no more than two enemies on screen at a time. But it does mix and match different types together, and in general extends the stages with additional hoodlums. There are a few other notable structural differences – namely, the fight on the huge moving bulldozer at the end of the forest level is missing, but to make up for its omission, the Lee brothers actually have to fight Willy before they meet their own shadows like in the arcade game. They also get to face the Shadow Master (now without the cape) on any difficulty level, although you miss out on the second round in a church and the good ending with Marion revived unless you beat the game on the Hard difficulty mode.",

However, the dragon will revert by one stage if the player character dies. \n \nThe game also has a currency system and stores, which can provide additional fire orb power-ups and other useful tools, like health restoration and barriers, if the player acquires enough funds before entering. \n \nThe game was released exclusively for the PC Engine.

All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!.",
    "summary": "Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.",

Shion was renamed Dyna and was modeled after a Hercules Beetle, and the final boss was changed to a giant lizard king. An English-language version was also produced, but both were built off of the Japanese version of Wonder Boy in Monster World.

As with every other game in the series, the game was never localized in North America or Europe.\n\nThe game uses the real life names of drivers and teams from Formula 1, like Nigel Mansell and Ferrari. The series would continue to acquire the various licenses needed to use real names from Formula 1.",

The player is responsible for paying salary to managers, mechanics, and other members of the staff; it is possible to raise or lower the salary, which may lead to various consequences depending on the employee's personality. Then the player makes contract with one or more drivers, selecting them from a list. Car customization plays an important role. Gasoline, engines, chassis, wheels, tires, brakes, and other components must be purchased from manufacturers of the player's choice. \n \nThe racing competition itself is non-interactive. Tournament events follow depending on its schedule, and the player simply watches how the race unfolds and ends according to the participants' parameters. Brand and player names in the game resemble real ones, but have been slightly altered for copyright reasons.",

As Earth is attacked by the alien war machines, it is revealed that the culprits are identified as the Gader'el, a race of large bio-mechanic creatures, who have the ability to freely manipulate space and time; after conquering the future Earth in the 25th century, the Gader'el decided to ensure their influence on mankind by traveling back in time to the 23rd century, conquering that time and then going further into Earth's past.\nAs the armed forces of every country on Earth combats the Gader'el, each scientific academy collaborates on making a weapon capable of destroying the Gader'el's strongest weapons. The result is the Dryad, a single-fighter spaceship capable of wielding several types of futuristic weapons.

    "summary": "Forgotten Worlds can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo. The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the \"roll switch\".Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a \"megacrush\" attack will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge. \n \nThe player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player. \n \nThe player can obtain blue-colored coins known as \"zennies\" from defeating enemies throughout the game. The zennies are used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consists primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also includes a health kit to restore lost vitality, an armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage. \n \nForgotten Worlds consists of five stages with a total of eight bosses. The player will lose if their vitality gauge runs out, but will be given a chance to continue.",

Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.",

Regulating every major facet of life throughout the world from politics and security to economics, MESIA was thought to be the savior of mankind. Over the years however, MESIA would have detractors who did not favor the path in which it set for man. This opposition of skilled intellectuals, warriors, and scientists, known as the \"OROPPAS\" (or opposition), would eventually corrupt MESIA and make it become self-aware, where it sought to eradicate all mankind.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop OROPPAS and subdue MESIA, everyone poured their remaining resources into an experimental, high-quality battle armour complete with a sophisticated A.I. known as \"Randy\", a powerful saber which cuts through nearly anything, and the most skilled pilot that they could elect, Ken Ryugasaki. Now, in the year 2230 AD, you must trudge through towns, jungles, and wasteland defeating mechanical menace, killing mutated creatures, and making your way to MESIA to defeat \"The Supreme Guardian\".",

For instance, the first stage gives you a choice between Anguirus and Rodan. Each battle is based around the movie it was based off of. For instance, Anguirus' stage has Godzilla appear as he did in 1955, uses Godzilla's roars from that film, and takes place at the Osaka Castle grounds. When the player completes a stage, they are rewarded with a certain amount of points. The better the player does in the stage (defeating the enemy in a short amount of time, the amount of health they have left, etc), the higher the score they will receive. When the player has gotten to Stage 6, they are once again told to pick their opponent, but this time, the player has up to six choices for their opponent, the number depending on score. The Super X II is always available, Mechagodzilla 2 is unlocked at 450,000 points, Biollante's Final Form is unlocked at 500,000 points, Mecha-King Ghidorah is unlocked at 550,000 points, Battra's Imago form is unlocked at 600,000 points, and Super Mechagodzilla is unlocked at 650,000 points.",

    "storyline": "The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\n\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.",
    "summary": "Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.",

    "summary": "The player returns as the role of the pilot of the Vic Viper spaceship to battle the second onslaughts of the Bacterion Empire, under the new leadership of Gofer, the giant head. Gradius II has kept the gameplay from the original game, but infused it with enhancements brought from the spin-off, Salamander (Life Force). This is primarily evident in two of the weapons configurations that are selectable. Another first in the series was the inclusion of the \"boss rush\" (also known as \"boss parade\" or \"boss alley\"), a level designed entirely with only boss confrontations.\n\nGradius II retains the selection bar from Gradius, but now the player can choose between four different weapon configurations and progressions. All schemes have speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double' (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples. Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of the entire spacecraft, withstanding three hits and it is included in four different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have to be activated twice to achieve full performance.",

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus (the game keeps track of score as money, not simply points). Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.",

Humanity tries to rebuild itself from the aftermath of the first Image Fight - the computer on the moon was destroyed and peace had finally returned. But three years after the attack, a space probe detects unknown objects hurtling towards planet Earth. The signs are clear - a massive alien invasion is underway. After a first encounter around Saturn, Image Fight requires the player to progress through four \"simulation stages\" - the last six \"real stages\" can only be accessed if the \"simulation\" achievement rating is greater enough. Failing this requirements leads to a short but intense Penalty Area. All the primary weapons from the original game are also here for the taking. Up to three colored orbs can be attached to the ship and either fire forwards (blue) or in the opposite way the ship is moving (Red). Secondary devices are also available and can be equipped at the front of the ship - they include all kind of lasers and missiles. However the only way to switch to a different device is to receive a direct hit.",

Use your head, your foot (kicking things brings great results) and your secret weapon - the spray-can - on 30 different enemies. So grab some french fries for energy and get ready for action!\n\nJ.J. & Jeff Detective Agency are assigned the task of locating a missing rich man, and you can choose either J.J. or Jeff to go on the mission. Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them.",

    "summary": "Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf is a golf-simulation video game developed by Sculptured Software, and published by Accolade in 1988. \nThe game features simulations of eighteen holes from renowned golf courses in the United States, Scotland, and England: Four from Augusta National Golf Club, three from Pebble Beach Golf Links, three from the Old Course at St Andrews, two from the Riviera Country Club, two from Baltusrol Golf Club, one from Oakmont Country Club, one from Merion Golf Club, one from Muirfield, and one from Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club. In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain. \nIt also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels. \nJack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade. The two companies developed it into a video game franchise, and Accolade published numerous adaptations and sequels for more than ten years.",

Therefore, they were able to breathe the air and use the land.Meanwhile, an army of robots wage World War IV against the demons in order to conquer what is now known as Makai - the Demon World. These robots came to the planet on a wave of energy that created an explosion that turned the world into a wasteland. Much later in the game, concurrent themes including Adolf Hitler, war, creating a perfect race of people, and the destruction of humanity in the year 1999 are revealed to the player inside one of the robot's main bases.\n\nCan the demons gain dominion on the humans' old planet or will robots enforce impose a millennium of logic and dictatorial force throughout Makai? Playing as the robots is not an option that is open to the player. Therefore, the player must take advantage of his or her mutant army and crush the robot invaders. This game builds on the fear of robot domination of the world that has been featured greatly in movies from The Terminator to Terminator Salvation. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy as the turn-based fights are viewed from a third-person perspective.",

    "slug": "loom",
    "storyline": "Prologue \nThe events of the game are preceded by a 30-minute audio drama. It is established that the Age of the Great Guilds arose when humans once again tried to establish dominion over nature. The world of \"Loom\" is not defined in relation to ours, but many hold that it happens on Earth in a greatly distant future, since the game takes place in the year 8021. \nPeople banded together to form city-states of a common trade \"devoted to the absolute control of knowledge, held together by stern traditions of pride, and of fear.\" The humble guild of Weavers established themselves as masters of woven fabric, though they eventually transcended the limits of cloth and began to weave \"subtle patterns of influence into the very fabric of reality.\" They were persecuted for these acts of \"witchcraft,\" and purchased an island far off the mainland coast, which they called Loom, after the great loom that was the symbol of their guild. \nLady Cygna Threadbare is introduced as a bereaved mother who begs the Elders of the Guild of Weavers to use the power of the Loom to end the suffering of the Weavers. Their numbers are failing and their seed is barren. The Elders Atropos, Clothos, and Lachesis, who are named after Greek mythology's three Fates, reprimand Cygna, telling her that it is not their place to play gods. \nCygna, despite their warnings, secretly assumes control of the Loom and plants one gray thread. She inadvertently draws an (unforeseen) infant out of the Loom, incurring the wrath of the Elders. She surrenders the child to Dame Hetchel, the old serving woman, and accepts her fate. The Elders cast the \"Transcendence\" draft on her, transforming her into a swan and banishing her from the pattern (the name Cygna is the feminine form of swan in Latin). Hetchel names the child Bobbin, and cares for him as her own. \nBobbin grows up ostracized from the rest of the Guild. The Elders note that the presence of his gray thread has thrown the pattern into chaos, and the Loom foresees the very unraveling of the pattern. For these reasons, the Elders ban him from learning the ways of the Guild until a decision can be made on Bobbin's seventeenth birthday (\"until his coming of age seventeen years hence,\" as it is described in the game's audio drama). Hetchel, however, defies the Elders and secretly teaches him a few basics of weaving. This is where the game begins. \n \nPlot \nOn his birthday, Bobbin is summoned by the Elders in order to determine his fate. He arrives at the Sanctuary in time to witness the Elders punish Hetchel with the \"Transcendence\" draft for educating Bobbin, but Hetchel reverts to a swan's egg, which puzzles and frightens the Elders. As they contemplate this turn of events a swan comes down from the sky and crashes through a window in the Sanctuary. She casts the \"Transcendence\" draft on the Elders, as well as the rest of the villagers, transforming all the Weavers except Bobbin into swans who leave through a rift in the sky. Bobbin, who is left all alone, finds Elder Atropos' distaff, and uses it to free Hetchel from her egg. \nHetchel, who is now a cygnet, tells Bobbin that the swan who visits him every year on his birthday came to save the Weavers from the Third Shadow that is about to cover the world. Bobbin then moves on to find the flock. On his way, he meets other guilds and has several adventures. Eventually, he encounters a Cleric, Bishop Mandible, who is after the Scrying Sphere of the Glassmakers, the swords of the Blacksmiths, and the products of the Shepherds. Mandible claims the Weaver's distaff to rule the world with an army of the undead, thus fulfilling the prophecies. By playing the draft of \"Opening\" on a nearby graveyard, he tears the fabric of the universe apart and allows an entity called \"Chaos\" to enter. Chaos kills Mandible and summons an army of undead to destroy the earth. Bobbin reclaims the distaff from the dead Bishop and heals many of the tears in the pattern, along the way helping many of his previous acquaintances, who were hurt or killed by Chaos's army. Finally, he battles Chaos, who is striving to take control of the great Loom on his native island. The battle ends as Chaos kills his stepmother using the draft of \"Unmaking.\" It is hinted, however, that it is still possible to save Hetchel, as \"one feather still remained intact.\" \nBobbin then destroys the great Loom using the same draft. He is joined by his mother and the other Weavers and is told that one half of the world will be ruled by Chaos while the Weavers will stay in the other half, and that with time, they may gain enough power to challenge Chaos again. Bobbin casts \"Transcendence\" upon himself, and with the aid of his mother and the other villagers in their swan forms, he flies away, carrying the ripple across the world. His friends watch the flock of the swans fly away; it remains unclear whether Bobbin has left them in Chaos' realm or has saved them.",
    "summary": "Long after the passing of the Second Shadow, when dragons ruled the twilight sky and the stars were bright and numerous, came the Age of the Great Guilds. \nBlacksmiths. Shepherds. Clerics. Each dedicated to the absolute control of secret knowledge. \nAnother such Guild was the Weavers. Over the centuries, their craft transcended the limits of physical cloth, until they wove the very fabric of reality itself. Now, a strange power has swept the Weavers into oblivion, leaving behind one Weaver boy to unravel the mystery. Help young Bobbin rescue his Guild...and you just might save the universe from an unspeakable catastrophe.",

They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side... \n \nMagicoal is a \"pseudo-RPG\", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time. \n \nMost of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be \"refilled\" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.",

    "summary": "A PC Engine Action-RPG based on the famous Japanese novel series Nansou Satomi Hakkenden. The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.\n\nUnlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.",

The game features the subtitle \"Neo Hardboiled Shooting\". \n \nThe goal of the game is to explore each stage, fight a boss and move onto the next. Some stages are comprised of several linear enclosed areas that require that the player clear the room of enemies before they can proceed, while others are more open and let the player scroll in multiple directions while seeking out their foes. The story is sparse, and concerns the player's testing out of a new Custom CS-05 tank through a series of simulations. \n \nThe game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. It has yet to be rereleased in any capacity.",

Small plants also appear on certain levels which can be \"watered\", causing them to grow and creating new platforms. Appropriately enough for a game which features water as the main weapon, many of the enemies and the later levels have a fire thematic.

    "summary": "Released specifically for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1993, Nexzr Special is a collection of short stages and modes that share their basic gameplay system and visuals with Nexzr. The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The \"Carnival Mode\" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.",

Three years later, the surviving pilot finally got a chance to avenge her death. Navigating a powerful new fighter ship named \"Slasher\", the pilot ventured into space, ready to bring destruction to those who took so much away from him.",
    "summary": "Nexzr is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up similar to Super Star Soldier. The player-controlled spaceship starts with a simple vulcan gun that can only shoot straight. Various power-ups can either enhance the strength of this gun, replace it with a laser weapon, or add a secondary weapon (homing fire, thin spreading laser attacks, etc.), which is activated automatically. Mid- and end-level bosses are encountered on nearly every stage. Additional lives can be collected, but the player always restarts from the beginning of the stage when his fighter craft is destroyed.",

    "storyline": "The game is based in a dystopian future where Banglar, the President of the United States in 1993, issues martial law on the nation, with the military having total control over the law. A group of anarchist scientists led by Mulk decide that it is time to revolt against the government. Knowing full well that approaching the military themselves could be considered an all out suicide mission, the scientists create two androids that can sustain various forms of damage in order to do the mission for them. The robots, code named \"Kunoichi\" (red female) and \"Ninja\" (blue male), are sent by the scientists in order to end Banglar's tyranny once and for all.\n\nNinja and Kunoichi each have different combos — one to be executed normally, and another that can be performed while crouching — and specific moves such as dash attacks, throwing, stabbing and air strikes. On the screen, separate from the life bar, there is a special energy bar that fills itself as the main character progress. When full, the bar will allow the player to perform a special move. If the character suffers some damage, the special bar will reset, starting a new count-up.",
    "summary": "The Ninja Warriors presents side-scrolling hand-to-hand combat. Players take control of Kunoichi or Ninja and fight wave after wave of Banglar forces across five levels.",

A mission is completed when all enemy forces are reduced to zero. The current level is completed when you escape from the airport with the prisoners. Your injury level increases when the enemy hits you. The game automatically ends if the injury indicator on the right side of the screen becomes completely red.

    "summary": "Pac-Land itself is split into trips. In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.\n\nThe penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.\n\nAs in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.",

    "summary": "It is a \"falling blocks\" puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise. The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.\n\nThe game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the \"hard\" difficulty level.",

It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters.\nThis game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.",

Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.\n\nThere are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans.\n\nYour buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down.\n\nFinish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.",
    "summary": "Power Drift is a kart racing game released in arcades by Sega in 1988. More technologically advanced than Sega's earlier 2.5D racing games, like Hang-On (1985) and Out Run (1986), in Power Drift the entire world and track consist of sprites. The upgraded hardware of the Sega Y Board allows individual sprites and the background to be rotated–even while being scaled–making the visuals more dynamic.\n\nDesigned and directed by Yu Suzuki, the game was a critical and commercial success upon release in arcades. It was subsequently ported to various home computers in Europe by Activision in 1989, followed by a PC Engine port published in Japan by Asmik Ace in 1990. It was not released on Sega consoles until the Sega Ages release for the Sega Saturn in 1998.",

His only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan's daughter (although the game never specifically mentions how). Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder levels). The game's unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. But in addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelgänger, an apparition of his own self that is conjured out of a magic mirror.",

The only way out is to blast your way past the grotesque creatures that block your path in five \"causes\" (stages). You must face the dangers of this psychedelic world by making full use of three shot types and the satellite option. With power-ups, you can change your shots to a wide-coverage beam, a satellite-generated laser and more. Each shot type can be powered up to three levels. You can also block enemy fire by rotating the satellites to a desired position. How you use these features will be the key to successfully escaping this strange and surreal world",

    "summary": "Raiden consists of eight vertical scrolling missions where the player maneuvers the Raiden craft dodging and destroying enemy robots, buildings, ground targets, and aircraft. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score. When player dies, the fighter's fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.\n\nAfter defeating the Stage 8 boss, the mission is completed, and player receives 1 million points for each completed loop. Afterwards, it will start back to Stage 1. This time around, enemies shoot faster and at a more rapid rate.",

However, their evil spirits were not completely destroyed, and now, in the world known as Dark Side, they seek the time of their rebirth. In order to shatter those ambitions, Kagekiyo must make his way across seven zones and head for \"The Heart of the Darkside\" where Yoritomo lies in wait. Use spirit weapons to power up your sword, or other items, such as candles to recover health, and defeat the endless hordes of enemies. Each zone is not only protected by a boss but also includes demons as well as real samurai from 12th-century Japan. Get ready for some intense one-on-one combat action.",

And the Ring of Five, which has protected Krelion for centuries untold has suddenly vanished from the land. Their fate is left in the unholy hands of three evil beings from the shadow realm known as the Dark Ones.\n\nNow the mid-summer equinox is almost at hand.

    "storyline": "Shin Megami Tensei takes place in a near future Tokyo, first in the year \"199X\", and then 30 years later in a post-apocalyptic version of the city. A rift has been opened to another world, allowing demons to invade Tokyo; by using a computer program, humans are able to communicate with and summon the demons. Across the story, moral alignments are portrayed in various ways: alongside the middle \"neutral\" pathway, the \"law\" faction believes in establishing a logical order at the expense of feeling and freedom, while the \"chaos\" faction espouses unlimited freedom for the individual while discarding the weak.",
    "summary": "The story follows a nameless protagonist who lives in near-future Tokyo. When a portal to the realm of demons is opened, United States officials order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent.\n\nThe gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.",

If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.\n\nJoe's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi's shurikens.[4]\n\nJoe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.\n\nAt the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player's score.",

    "summary": "Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead is a PC Engine remake of the MSX2 post apocalyptic RPG of the same name.\n\nDue to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\"PS\") and Mind Force (\"MF\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church.\n\nLaila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth. Player's progression is saved through a long password system.",

No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure.

As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main hero and his companions on the top-down \"world map\", entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective. \n \nAs in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell. \n \nThere is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are closed, but certain characters might appear only during that time.",

Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.\n\nThe goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.\n\nSon Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.",

The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.",

    "storyline": "Two college students, Rick Taylor and Jennifer Willis, take refuge from a storm in West Mansion, a local landmark known as \"Splatterhouse\" for the rumors of hideous experiments purportedly conducted there by Dr. West, a renowned and missing parapsychologist. As they enter the mansion and the door shuts behind them, Jennifer screams.\n\nRick awakens in the dungeon of the mansion to discover that he is still alive thanks to the influence of the \"Terror Mask\", or in some versions, the \"Hell Mask\", a Mayan sacrificial artifact from West's house which is capable of sentient thought. The mask attaches itself to Rick, fusing with his body and transforming him into a monster with superhuman strength. With the mask's encouragement, Rick goes on a rampage through the dungeon and the mansion grounds, killing hordes of monsters. Inside the mansion, Rick finds Jennifer, prone on a couch and surrounded by a throng of creatures that retreat upon his arrival. After their departure, Jennifer transforms into a giant, fanged monster that attempts to kill Rick while begging him for help. Rick is forced to kill Jennifer, who transforms back to normal and thanks him before she dies. Infuriated, Rick tracks the remaining monsters to a giant, bloody hole in the mansion's floor. Upon entering it, Rick discovers that the mansion itself is alive. He follows a bloody hallway to the house's \"womb\", which produces fetus-like monsters that attack him. Rick destroys the womb, which causes the house to burst into flames as it \"dies\".\n\nEscaping the burning mansion, Rick comes across a grave marker. The Terror Mask releases energy into the grave, reviving a giant monster named \"Hell Chaos\" that claws its way up from the earth and attempts to kill Rick. Rick destroys the creature, which unleashes a tormented ghost that dissipates into a series of bright lights. As the lights vanish, the mask shatters, turning Rick back to normal, and he flees as the house burns to the ground and the credits roll. However, after he leaves and the credits end, the Terror Mask reassembles itself and laughs evilly, staying there for 45 seconds, with the word \"END\" appearing on the bottom right corner of the screen.",
    "summary": "Splatterhouse is a sidescrolling beat 'em up video game in which the player controls Rick, a parapsychology student who is trapped inside West Mansion. After his resurrection by the Terror Mask, Rick makes his way through the mansion, fighting off hordes of creatures in a vain attempt to save his girlfriend Jennifer from a grisly fate. Players of this game will also recognize a number of western horror film influences, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead 2.\n\nSimilar to many sidescrolling beat 'em up games, Rick can only move in a two-dimensional environment. The playing field does not feature a three-dimensional area, a feature that was added later in the series with Splatterhouse 3. He has the ability to jump and can punch and kick. Rick also has a Special Attack, where he will perform a drop kick that sends him skidding along the ground, damaging any enemies he hits. Rick can also perform a low kick, low punch, and jumping attacks, as well as pick up and use various weapons placed in the levels.\n\nAll of the levels consist of walking left to right, with occasional auto-scrolling segments. However, alternative pathways through sections of the house are possible by falling down through holes or jumping up onto ladders. In this way, branching gameplay is possible, if only prevalent in the middle levels. Levels culminate in boss fights that take place in a single room. Unlike traditional side-scrolling fighters, boss fights have varying objectives and styles. Unlike most arcade games in the genre, Splatterhouse sends players back to checkpoints after losing lives or reaching game over, discouraging \"credit feeding\" as a method of overcoming the various challenges.",

The game also features the 2 and 5 minute high score time attack modes seen in previous games.\n\nHowever, in parodying the hard sci-fi atmosphere of the Star Soldier games, Star Parodier takes a light hearted approach by featuring cute, cartoonish graphics and toning down the violence (for example, defeated enemies wave white flags in surrender). The players choose from one of three craft to play as in the game: the Paro Ceaser from Star Soldier, a giant flying Bomberman or an anthropomorphic PC Engine console that shoots HuCards and CD-ROMs at enemies.\n\nThe game was originally only released in Japan, though it was also intended to be released in North America under the name Fantasy Star Soldier.",

Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....\n\nThe player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air.

    "summary": "Street Fighter II': Champion Edition is a competitive fighting game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1992. It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.\n\nis the first update to the game. The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four.\n\nChampion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity. One in particular is Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition.\nChampion Edition was followed by Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.",

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.\n\nThe game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.\n\nThe red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the \"missile\" main weapon and \"bomb\" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.\n\nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.\n\nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.",

    "summary": "Sylphia is a vertical shooter published by Tonkin House. The game draws from Greek mythology and tells the story of Sylphia, a female warrior with a tragic destiny. Her tale starts as she lays fatally wounded in the temple of Athena - merciless monsters have taken over the city and she perished as she desperately tried to protect innocent villagers. The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level). Sylphia consists of eight stages and is single player only.",

The evil Gidans are about to invade the Borogo system, their armada of giant asteroids are approaching and they have to be stopped. The player must infiltrate and destroy no less than five large enemy facilities and take down swarms of alien ships and all kind of ground units. The space fighter comes equipped with a default Vulcan gun (Power shots) and two more weapons are available for the taking - the blue lock-on lasers (Thunder Laser) and green blasts of energy (Tatsujin Beam). The only way to increase the active weapon's firepower is to collect Power Boosters special flying pods leave behind. Although five boosters are necessary to trigger a power-up upgrade and boost up the strength of the current weapon, special red flashing power icons bring it up to maximum power in no time. Each weapon can be powered up to three times for maximum collateral damage and smart bombs in the shape of monstrous skull-faced energy blasts can be unleashed to kill most enemies on screen. Finally, speed boosters are strategically placed throughout the game to help the player dodge enemy fire more efficiently.",

Unlike the original, Terra Cresta II skipped the Arcade and was released on the PC Engine.\n\nThe game uses a distinct power-up system where the player is acquiring additional modules for their spaceship. These modules can be configured in two ways: one configuration has them connected directly to the ship, increasing its firepower, where the second has them separate from the central ship to increase their coverage. Before starting, the player can choose which direction the ship modules will fire in and the positions they take around the central ship when separated. Through this system, the player can fine-tune the amount of coverage their bullets will reach.",

Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.\nFor generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist of eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.",
    "summary": "Turrican is a 1990 video game programmed and designed by Manfred Trenz. It was first developed for the Commodore 64 by Rainbow Arts, but was ported to other systems later. In addition to concept design and character creation, Trenz personally programmed Turrican on the Commodore 64. A sequel, Turrican II, followed 1991 for the Commodore 64 and other platforms.",

It's up to the Japanese schoolgirl Yuko to take on her persona of the Valis Soldier and vanquish Megas.\n\nGameplay-wise, this version differs from the computer releases significantly. Though it has six stages that end with the same boss enemies, its level design, layout, and many regular enemies are different. This release also completely removes two key gameplay features of the computer version: the ability to equip different weapons and armor, and the flying side-scrolling shooter stages.",

But a new threat has arisen: an enigmatic man named Glames from the Dark World, possessor of a sword named Leethus, is planning to conquer both Earth and Vecanti, convinced that there is no other way to save his world from imminent destruction. A young girl from the Dark World named Cham escapes from Glames, and asks Yuko to help her stop him with the aid of her Valis sword.\n\nLike its predecessors in the series, Valis III is a side-scrolling platform action game. Unlike the previous installments, the player can control three characters in the game: Yuko, Cham (who uses a whip and fights similarly to Castlevania protagonists), and princess Valna from Vecanti, who is weaker physically, but can cast more powerful magic. Each of the characters can equip different weapons and has access to her own magic spells.",

A member of her band, named Lena, requests permission to infiltrate Galgear's stronghold and free Valna on her own; Cham initially disagrees, but a disembodied voice convinces her to allow this, and Lena brings her twin sister Amu with her. They both succeed in reaching Galgear's inner sanctum, but are stopped by the prince and his ring, who is about to obliterate them when they are teleported away by a magic force—that of Asfal, the prince's father, who tells them that only the Valis sword, no longer in this world, can stop him. Both girls journey day and night to reach the heavens of Vecanti and claim the sword, which is bequeathed onto them by Yuko herself, sent with her blessings in stopping the power-hungry prince. They return to Vecanti and use the mystic blade to defeat Galgear.",

The clock tower at the end of the first stage also looks like a miniature Big Ben.",

Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur. The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.",

They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!",

    "summary": "Once in the game, using the arrow keys you can move the 'Scanner' ship around the 'Shield Line' at the parameter of the playing area. While moving around this edge the ship is protected from the aliens by a shield indicated by a glowing circle around the ship. This shield is not infinite and care should be taken to complete each level as quickly as possible. A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the 'Shield Line' or not.\nThe idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the 'Laser Cutter' and moving off the 'Shield Line' and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.\n\nWhen you rejoin the 'Shield Line' the area that does not contain the 'Boss' alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the 'Shield Line' will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in. This percentage starts at 80% but may increase in the later levels.",

    "storyline": "Ages have past in the kingdom of Llylgamyn. The decedents of the legendary heroes have disappeared, but the Orb they brought to the city held a great deal of knowledge. The magicks hidden within the sacred Orb of Earithin were beyond what anyone had ever imagined. It revealed many secrets of life and magic. In fact, since its discovery the entire school of magic was reorganized. Spells were improved and even new spells were concocted to replace their inferior cousins. Once balance was restored to the kingdom, the Orb was placed in the hands of The Brotherhood of Llylgamyn for safe keeping. Peace once again fell over the land.\n\nSlowly things grew dark again. The strange weather returned, the people began falling ill. What was happening? Did the orb lose it's power? An emergency meeting of the High Council was called. They spent weeks deliberating behind closed doors. Together through powerful magic and the grace of both the ancient and the new gods, they found an answer...\n\nFor some unknown reason, the very fabric in which reality is comprised was unraveling, The source of all this chaos was an unnatural, magical vortex, it seems to be located in a series of maze-like caverns beneath the Brotherhood's Temple. The maze below the city is known as the Maelstrom. The Maelstrom is home to many foul beasts and also to outcasts from the land above. It seems that the vortex is located in the very heart of the Maelstrom. The rift grows daily, and if something isn't done it will engulf the city, then the kingdom and soon the entire world. Then eventually even reality as we know it will cease to exist.\n\nThe sages knew of only one answer, to seek help from the demi-god known as Gatekeeper. Once a mortal, his power grew to a point where he soon evolved to a divine status. It had become his responsibility to watch and preserve the balance of magic and the natural world. He might be the only hope, assuming he would even be willing to listen to mortals at all.\n\nThe Sages were confident their call would be answered, so grave was the danger. However, to their utter horror, they learned that the Gatekeeper himself was held prisoner in the heart of the very vortex they wished him to destroy! Terrified, the Sages turned to the Brotherhood, whose knowledge of the mystical and magical exceeded their own. Here, a tale of evil and treachery was scryed by Brother Drew, High Prophet of the Brotherhood.\n\nThey learned of a renegade Brother, a woman named The Sorn, whose wish it is to end all order in the universe. She had discovered a means to create an ever-growing rift in reality, the vortex that now threatens our land. From this will come a new universe where chaos will reign and the world will no longer exist. It was she who trapped the Gatekeeper and made him prisoner. She must be stopped, lest everyone will perish.\n\nIt's been 3 years since this discovery, and the vortex continues to grow. Time is growing short. Two of the most powerful sages in the kingdom, Fontizan and the High Sage Yeldarb have began to seek warriors brave enough to enter the caverns beneath the temple of the brotherhood, find the Gatekeeper and free him from the vortex. However, first they must defeat the evil Sorn, which is quest in itself.\n\nIn order to even have a chance, the adventurers must first seek out G'bli Gedook, the High Priest of the Brotherhood. He is the guardian of the Orb of Llylgamyn. He resides in the first layer of the caverns just under the temple. From their they must descend into the depths of the maze and battle whatever The Sorn can conjure up to stop them.\n\nWho will step up to take this challenge? Will the old heroes return or will new heroes be made?\n\nThat is unknown, but whoever takes this challenge may La-La and Kadorto be with them.",

So once again a party of adventurers must venture forth to vanquish the evil.\n\nWizardry V represents a complete revision of the gaming system used in the first four installments, with larger mazes, new spells and character classes, and an expanded system for combatting and interacting with creatures. It is also the first game in the series that allows, but does not require characters imported from a previous scenario.",

    "summary": "Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.\n\nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.\n\nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.",

As Adol goes to the seer Sara, she tells him of an even greater darkness in the land of Celceta and asks the red-haired swordsman to go there and seek the truth behind this mystery. Thus, Adol steals away unnoticed in the middle of the night to embark on his next adventure.\n\nIn Celceta, Adol will learn of the Romun Empire’s ambitions, fight the mysterious Clan of Darkness that seeks to ressurect their long dead leader, and discover the ancient history of Celceta itself as well as its connection to the land of Ys.
