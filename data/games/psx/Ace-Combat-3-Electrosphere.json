Its campaign featured 52 missions that were split among different paths depending on in-mission decisions. The story centered around the \"Intercorporate War\" in 2040 between Neucom Incorporated and the General Group.\n\nThe international version of Ace Combat 3 was released in 2000 and was localized for specific regions. However, its campaign had 36 out of the original 52 missions with no different paths. The story, as well as all related voice acting and cutscenes, was removed and replaced with a more basic story with no voice acting.","total_rating":75.6233798615641,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ace-combat-3-electrosphere","videos":[{"id":13027,"game":14751,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"Juw9fTvGmHg","checksum":"e31c6a2e-fa87-9987-2fba-585a151a3527"}]}
