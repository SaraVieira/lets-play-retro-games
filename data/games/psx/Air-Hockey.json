(SuperLite 1500 Series)) is a budget air hockey game for the PlayStation. There are four characters available to either play as or to face off against. The aim is to have a higher score than your opponent when the timer hits zero, and to make that a little easier there are bonuses strewn across the table. Some are activated upon touch, while others are stored with the player until used.\n\nThe only two gameplay options are 1 player versus the computer or 2 players versus each other.\n\nStrange & futuristic hockey game with cartoon graphics.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/air-hockey"}
