Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: \"Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,\", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/armored-core-project-phantasma"}
