It's two games in one for twice the fun! Both events have a practice area where Barbie gives advice on how to race and get better scores, which will earn tickets that can be traded in for better equipment. And you'll need better equipment if you want to beat Barbie and her friends. After beating the computer-controlled opponents, challenge your friends to a race with the Two-Player mode, or see who can complete a course the fastest in the Time-Trial mode. Whether it is snowboarding or in-line skating, with Barbie anything is possible.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-super-sports"}
