Pick the rods and lures that fit your fishing style and get ready to reel. While out on the lake, make new friends who will offer advice or a challenge; completing challenges opens new areas to fish. Every area requires finesse, not brawn, to bring in the catch. Never miss a second of the fight with a unique underwater perspective that shows how hard the fish are working. Everything for a great day out on the lake is in BASS RISE, and the best part is, you won't have to clean the fish after you catch them.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bass-rise"}
