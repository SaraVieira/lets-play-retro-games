Try to reel in 14 different types of freshwater fish including spotted bass, redeye bass, and rock bass in this PSX classic, enjoying a dozen massive locales. Real-life obstacles like rod direction, reel speed, and water structures will provide plenty to overcome, but you'll arrive armed with 20 unique lures to help get the job done. Choosing from a selection of spinners, bucktails, bass bugs, and other stuff that will help get those fishes' attention, you'll try to master any of the three impressive modes of play: Free Fishing, Three-day Tournament, and Beat the Clock. Five total events will ensure that the gameplay never repeats itself, and the graphics are downright incredible. It's not easy to hook and reel a bass, but it sure is fun when you do.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/big-bass-fishing"}
