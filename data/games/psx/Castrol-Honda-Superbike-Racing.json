The player can choose between four playing modes: practice session (just racing alone on a track), trainer session (following another bike to learn the ideal line), single race or championship (one season over all 14 courses). The two latter ones optionally also include a qualifying session. While there is only one bike (Honda RC 45). it is possible to change its setup (gearbox, front tire, rear tire, final drive, gears).\n\nSingle races and championship can also be played with a second player in split-screen.
