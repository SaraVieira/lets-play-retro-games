story tells of a group of villages, Weedom, all living in harmony with one another and nature. However, according to the legend, every hundred years a group of \"armored beasts\" emerge from \"the dark core of the earth\" to serve their master, the Queen Pede, and aid her in the destruction of the Wee people. Every time this happens a magic stick is employed to find a hero to defend them. Every time the insects are defeated, the villagers believe that the threat has permanently ended; but they always return, as the legend indicates.\n\nThe player plays as Wally, the chosen hero to fight the insects that century, who is to take control of the shooter, a vehicle made for, as its name indicates, rendering shots against the insect menace. Thus, the player embarks a journey across five worlds: Weedom, Frostonia, Inferium, Enigma, and Evile (each consisting of about 5 levels each, with the final level of each including a boss that must be defeated), in order to end the curse forever.","summary":"Enter the world of the Wee People and do your best to save them from the QueenPede, who will stop at nothing to destroy this peaceful race of humanoids. In this remake of the classic Atari game, players take the role of Wally, the village's humble bean counter, as he is quickly recruited to man the village bug shooter and sent off to save the colony from the ruthless QueenPede and her destructive subjects -- the spiders, scorpions, and fleas -- as she sets out to conquer the peaceful wee people. Work your way through all-new 3D worlds with new weapons and skills. And if you're really good, you might just discover the original Centipede.","total_rating":70.06020554549515,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/centipede--2","videos":[{"id":1298,"game":2237,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"iuD9vJFaWHY","checksum":"ddeb75e9-3b6a-466f-7e2b-4ef8db02c298"}]}
