Convinced that they hold tremendous power, he takes one and gets back onto his laboratory. One year later, Cortex and his new assistant Dr. N. Gin rebuild an upgraded Cortex Vortex in outer space which will turn everyone on Earth into his mindless slaves. But they need 25 more crystals to reach the Vortex's maximum capacity, and they do not have any of their operatives left on Earth. Cortex then devises a plot to manipulate Crash into retrieving the crystals for him.","summary":"Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is the second game in the Crash Bandicoot series, and the sequel to the original game. The gameplay is largely similar to that of the original, as players make their way through a limited environment whilst breaking crates that contains bonuses. The goal of the game is to gather 25 crystals for Crash's nemesis, Doctor Neo Cortex. The crystals are scattered between 25 different levels accessible via Warp Rooms, which are hub areas of the game. A level is cleared by collecting its respective crystal and reaching the end of its path, which returns Crash to the Warp Room.","total_rating":83.7280225874201,"total_rating_count":354,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back","videos":[{"id":869,"game":1186,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"eq4NVclbP-0","checksum":"005f297a-0f6e-9d79-5608-458e6a03256b"},{"id":34659,"game":1186,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Eim9-IV7NiA","checksum":"013a6449-5b4a-4807-74eb-5de359ed864b"}]}
