Players are armed with a variety of weapons (chainsaws, grenades, machine guns, etc...) and a full range of unarmed combat moves (including the good old-fashioned crotch kick) all of which can be used to defend the goal but remember, the best defense is a good offense. \n \nDBZ also has many of the features you would expect from a typical sports game including player development, league and season management, and stat tracking (scores, kills, etc...).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dbz-dead-ball-zone"}
