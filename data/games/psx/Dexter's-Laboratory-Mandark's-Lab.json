Both Dee Dee's Dance Off, which has players pressing buttons in time to music, and Cootie Call where Dexter exterminates flying cootie bugs, take place in Dee Dee's bedroom. What's Buggin' Dexter, a foot race between Dexter and a bug that could potentially infect his computer, takes place in his computer's circuit board, and Dexter's Dodgeball takes place in the school yard with Dexter targeting school bullies with playground balls.","total_rating":79.6583480533008,"total_rating_count":8,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dexter-s-laboratory-mandark-s-lab"}
