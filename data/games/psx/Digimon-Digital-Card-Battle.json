It sounds impossible, but you'd better believe it! Full of intense strategy and hardcore tactical maneuvering, DIGIMON DIGITAL CARD BATTLE is a genuine test of your skills and smarts. Each victory will increase your strength level, allowing you to move on to the next stage of play. Three Partner Decks will be at your disposal throughout play: Veemon will help you with offense; Armodillomon will provide surprise attacks; and Hawkmon will lend itself to quick digi-volving. The 40 new characters will provide plenty for series addicts to sink their teeth into, while 30 varieties of power-up cards will help gamers take down their competition. If all of this sounds like a foreign language to you, you're due to dive into the magical world of trainers and their monsters, known as DIGIMON.
