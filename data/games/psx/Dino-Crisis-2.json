Regina is sent on a rescue mission with her new ally Dylan Morton, who has a strange connection to the events on the island. The player switches between controlling Regina and Dylan at specific points in the game.","summary":"Dino Crisis 2 is a third-person action-adventure game and sequel to Dino Crisis. In a change from the survival horror theme of the first game, Dino Crisis 2 is more shoot 'em up oriented. The character always runs, thus removing the need for the run button from the first game, a second gun can be carried and more weapons were added to the game. Besides changes to the gameplay, the game also introduces new species of dinosaurs and lizards.","total_rating":85.9517953197265,"total_rating_count":110,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dino-crisis-2","videos":[{"id":5522,"game":4132,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vsuwd8-Cc24","checksum":"7244c47a-ac7b-f744-30a4-1ff46ff11089"},{"id":36004,"game":4132,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"IwYtgnwslfE","checksum":"3bd2527e-ea77-150a-f43e-6dca64f81a03"}]}
