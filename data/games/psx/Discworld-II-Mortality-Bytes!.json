The game was developed and produced in 1996 by Perfect Entertainment for the PC, and ported in 1997 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was published by Psygnosis for the PC and PlayStation, and by Sega for the Saturn (only in Europe).\n\nIn Discworld II the player controls Rincewind the \"wizzard\" (voiced by Eric Idle, as in the previous game) who has been burdened with the task of coercing Death out of his impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The plot borrows from a number of Discworld books, most notably Reaper Man, Moving Pictures and Lords and Ladies.\n\nIt all begins in a quiet Ankh-Morpork street, where Rincewind and The Librarian inexplicably fail to die from a nearby cart-bomb explosion. The odd event is not shared by them alone however: occurrences of the newly dead re-awakening and disturbing the populace are being reported all over the city, prompting the Archchancellor of Unseen University to halt his usual activities of feasting and merrymaking, and to take charge of the situation. Much to Rincewind's despair, the entirety of this process involves appointing him to the task of finding Death and convincing him to resume his work.","total_rating":90.84718838213129,"total_rating_count":24,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/discworld-ii-mortality-bytes","videos":[{"id":73168,"game":8292,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"WfMm4mkyTn4","checksum":"98863756-7240-91c7-e3c1-f0bef66a8ce5"},{"id":73169,"game":8292,"name":"Teaser","video_id":"lST3b24nVYE","checksum":"40d03ce1-1154-2dd4-fdd8-5acd0c7f62c1"}]}
