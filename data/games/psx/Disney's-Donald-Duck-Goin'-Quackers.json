Due to a lack of power, the device can't teleport Donald to Merlock's temple (where Daisy is held) right away. Instead, Donald must successively install reflector dishes at high points at Duckie Mountain, Duckburg and the flying mansion of Magica De Spell before he can reach the temple.","total_rating":75.8281052311753,"total_rating_count":20,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/donald-duck-goin-quackers","videos":[{"id":32924,"game":10610,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"UHT3t3GuwjE","checksum":"b43926f2-5b7f-fb42-db12-25dc84e5b36b"}]}
