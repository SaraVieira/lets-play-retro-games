Tanner and his partner, Tobias Jones, are working together to capture a moneyman who has double crossed a crime lord. The moneyman is known as 'Pink Lenny' throughout the story, and he is portrayed as a weasel in the opening cutscene. Pink Lenny has double crossed Solomon Caine, and is now working for his enemy, a Brazilian known as Alvaro Vasquez. Tanner must find and capture Pink Lenny, as Solomon Caine wants to kill him for double crossing him. Lenny has also been responsible for causing a large gang war in Chicago through his actions.\n\nThe elusive Avaro Vasquez, head of the tattooed Brazilian mob operating out of Rio, is turning his business interests to mainland USA. Violence threatens to ignite America when a U.S. crimelord`s money-man cuts a deal with Vasquez - his greatest rival.","summary":"You are an undercover driver, trying to survive amidst an international war between American and Brazilian gangs. The action takes you to Chicago, Las Vegas, Rio and Havana, all of which are depicted in detail, with curved roads added from the first game.\n\nAs before, you have full control over the car as it storms around the streets. A new feature is the ability to get out of the car, and carjack others. This is especially useful when you have fallen victim to the advanced damage modeling.\n\nThere is a full sequence of missions to complete, as well as some pre-set challenges and a Free Driving mode allowing you to explore at your leisure.","total_rating":61.13613541442015,"total_rating_count":70,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/driver-2-back-on-the-streets","videos":[{"id":13067,"game":6391,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"GfGzCw7v_xo","checksum":"d79fe72f-bd79-779d-7a9f-01d42d3332a2"},{"id":13208,"game":6391,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"c-AKJcwvZD0","checksum":"1c576e41-a84b-ac24-bd1d-f3f5c0878395"}]}
