Unfortunately, the floppy-eared rabbit doesn't have enough eggs, so players will have to solve puzzles and play games to find more eggs.\n\nMultiple difficulty levels keep the action interesting for children aged four to ten, and several game modes offer additional play options. Parents can play along with children and add assistance with the \"helper\" feature.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/easter-bunnys-big-day","videos":[{"id":75278,"game":44947,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"DG0JsBOpmZw","checksum":"f11629f4-6c08-bd8e-6cf6-43ca29b31aaf"}]}
