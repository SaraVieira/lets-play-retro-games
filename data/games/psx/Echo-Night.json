When confronted by a ghost the player must turn on the lights in the room by means of a light switch. The player is often transported into the past via the passengers or certain objects. Once the player fulfills a task important to a spirit they will vanish and drop an \"Astral Piece\" which can be used to get a different ending scene.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/echo-night-2-nemuri-no-shihaisha","videos":[{"id":47852,"game":43882,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"siSU959tL04","checksum":"6ccac2b6-3393-d179-17eb-8c3551869102"}]}
