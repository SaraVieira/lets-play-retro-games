Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockhart are playable in the arcade and the PlayStation versions, and Sephiroth, Yuffie Kisaragi, Vincent Valentine and Zack Fair were added to the PlayStation version's roster. Ehrgeiz differs from most 3D fighting games by drawing heavily from the concepts of wrestling games and Dream Factory's own Tobal series, which allow for full 360-degree movement and do not require fighters to be facing each other at all times.","total_rating":63.7967586751968,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ehrgeiz"}
