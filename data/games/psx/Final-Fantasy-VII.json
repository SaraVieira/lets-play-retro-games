Apathetic to the cause, Cloud initially fights for personal gain, and for the promise he made to childhood friend Tifa Lockhart. Cloud eventually joins forces with many others to save the planet, which is threatened by Shinra and Cloud's nemesis Sephiroth, and discovers a reason to fight for a cause other than his own.","summary":"Final Fantasy VII is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series, and was the first title to feature three-dimensional graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds and numerous full motion videos.\n\nThe gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, FFVII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills.\n\nThough minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.","total_rating":87.72817602584465,"total_rating_count":1099,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-vii","videos":[{"id":232,"game":427,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"oRanxri0sYs","checksum":"dbc63ae6-47dc-1ea8-4a80-5a3ff4c67a10"},{"id":48712,"game":427,"name":"Dev Diary","video_id":"jNQfY3G35y0","checksum":"82b29157-f8a9-205a-7758-8d65cd101aa7"},{"id":71393,"game":427,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"h0mqRkhOvtY","checksum":"692e9f9d-94ba-7be5-8521-38a2c659b767"}]}
