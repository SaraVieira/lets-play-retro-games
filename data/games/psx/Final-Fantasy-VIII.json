Squall and his friends are enlisted to help a group known as the Forest Owls led by Rinoa Heartilly, an endeavor that escalates into a conflict against the forces led by Sorceress Edea.","summary":"Final Fantasy VIII is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series. The gameplay makes a departure from many series standards. While it still uses the Active Time Battle system, it deviates from the series' traditional means of boosting a character's power via leveling, although levels are not completely abandoned as they were in Final Fantasy II. In addition, it does not have a Magic Point-based system for spell-casting. Instead, magic is collected, drawn, and created from items, and is used to power up the characters via the junction system.","total_rating":86.02053954140665,"total_rating_count":389,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-viii","videos":[{"id":321,"game":425,"name":"Commercial","video_id":"u49xPK3QOl8","checksum":"6c4775ce-393e-1ae9-8570-ea323b555fd2"}]}
