The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered. \n \nAfter an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival. \n \nWhen the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/g-police-weapons-of-justice"}
