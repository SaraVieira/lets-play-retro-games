It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners. So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful.\n\nSuccess will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech equipment remain in one piece.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gubble","videos":[{"id":17775,"game":44937,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"hjpkJEC6CGI","checksum":"b2e2f3be-0246-10c7-83bc-8f8684ec111f"}]}
