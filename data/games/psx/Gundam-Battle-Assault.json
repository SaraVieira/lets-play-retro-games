This robotic brawler pits Gundam against Gundam using a traditional side-view fighting engine. \n \nThe different robots that appear in Gundam Battle Assault spring forth from all over the series' lengthy fictional timeline. New fans will most recognize the Gundam Wing model, while those who've followed the different shows for a while will find many old favorites, such as Z Gundam, Qubeley, and Zaku II.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gundam-battle-assault"}
