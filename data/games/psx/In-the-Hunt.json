He asks Tigger, a tiger with spring-like tail, to help him collect the honey they will need to have the party. Other friends from the Hundred Acre Wood such as Owl, Rabbit, Kanga, Piglet and Roo, also help Tigger find the honey they will need. After traveling through six areas and completing three minigames, Tigger goes to talk to Christopher Robin about finding more honey and he suggests different kinds of food. The party is a big success thanks to Pooh and Tigger.","summary":"Winnie the Pooh needs YOU! How can he throw a party without honey?
