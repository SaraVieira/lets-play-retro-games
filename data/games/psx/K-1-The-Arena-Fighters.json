You can choose from eight fighters based on real-world kickboxers, and then experience the brutal nature of the sport in a Single-Player match, or try to become champion in a Tournament. If you're looking for a different kind of challenge, pick a team of boxers, and beat up the opposition in the Team Challenge mode. If your friends challenge your dominance of the ring, put them in their place with a match in the Versus mode. No matter what mode you play, motion-captured animation makes all the characters move realistically. If you are good enough, you can unlock a video that shows how the motion-capture work was done. Do you have the stamina to become the best of the best in K-1 THE ARENA FIGHTERS?","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/k-1-the-arena-fighters","videos":[{"id":63480,"game":43723,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"G00NXmaUgog","checksum":"1c06e302-e29d-d6d2-46b4-740e6ad86380"},{"id":63811,"game":43723,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"Xa424xuSK4k","checksum":"04beb17e-6728-b184-0ea4-dd72f039a97e"}]}
