The plot is split up into several storylines that all interwine with each other: the history of the monastery itself as a prison for heretics and political adversaries, where the inmates were ruthlessly tortured and killed; the tragic fate of Charlotte, who was locked up in the monastery from birth and was executed at a young age, never knowing why, who believed she was never loved and now haunts the mansion; and Ogden's past as the captain of the sunken ship The Princess Alice, his friendship with the kind Elaine and the events occurring after Elaine's death.","summary":"Koudelka is the precursor (prequel) to Sacnoth's Shadow Hearts series. Shadow Hearts takes place in the Koudelka universe and features various locales and characters from Sacnoth's debut work.","total_rating":70.2665782518242,"total_rating_count":19,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/koudelka","videos":[{"id":5243,"game":4169,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"DBj7UJK4AYI","checksum":"3c7e4493-51f5-cfc0-d4f8-6ba894e13e79"}]}
