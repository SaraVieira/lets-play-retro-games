The rules of Arena Football differ from the NFL in number of ways. Most notably, the field is only 50-yards long and balls played off the large nets to the sides of the goalposts are live. All of your favorite teams from the AFL are included, so pick your team and get ready for some fast football action. Once you choose a team, you can take on all of the other teams in the Arcade mode, try to become the best player on the field in a Tournament, or for the ultimate challenge, try to make it to the championship by fighting through the Arena League Season. If you don't like the way your team is performing, edit the plays with offensive and defensive play editors. If you are a fan of the 50-yard indoor war, then get a copy of KURT WARNER'S ARENA FOOTBALL UNLEASHED. \n \nKurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed is a sports game developed and published by Midway for the Sony PlayStation. It was released in North America on May 18, 2000. It is of note that it would not be until 2006 before another AFL video game would be released. It is based around the fame of American football champion Kurt Warner. It is a modified version of NFL Blitz set in the Arena Football League. Arena ball is a version of American football played indoors on a 50 yard field with nets behind each endzone and boards on the sidelines. \n \nKurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed differs from other American football video games due to its usage of the arena football system. A few rule changes include that there are half as many players on the field, field goals go back into play if they miss the goalposts, and there's no such thing as punting. The game is compared to NFL Blitz 2000 for its violence, and one reviewer even noted that \"The post-play violence has been pumped up to the level that Blitz had before the NFL forced Midway to tone it down.\" \n \nA Dreamcast version was announced at the same time as \"Arena Football\" prior to rebranding to \"Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed\", however the Dreamcast version was cancelled for unknown reasons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kurt-warners-arena-football-unleashed","videos":[{"id":47739,"game":43721,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"XjnT9cHSumc","checksum":"5a29d2f5-553c-ac28-ec5c-9ae6ec6517d3"}]}
