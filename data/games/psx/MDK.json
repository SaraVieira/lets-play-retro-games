These Minecrawlers are not only removing all of earth's natural resources, but are also crushing any people and cities that get in their way. Aided by his boss, the (possibly) insane inventor/scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and a genetically engineered robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Bones (although he prefers Max), Kurt must infiltrate each Minecrawler, and fight his way to the pilot, whom he must then kill before returning to Hawkins' in-orbit space station, the Jim Dandy.","total_rating":77.6658679515282,"total_rating_count":84,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mdk","videos":[{"id":379,"game":219,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"2W7lSFFuB9k","checksum":"bcc1c235-7d02-72d4-fd2f-eb1077e38ffc"},{"id":2771,"game":219,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"iLRi2CbmHs0","checksum":"ccbad7e5-e3f4-6d90-b32a-7824ba387dd5"}]}
