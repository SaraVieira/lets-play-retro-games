Choose a team and lead your squad through a grueling, 162-game regular season, into the Playoffs, and straight to the World Series. All of the Major League teams, stadiums, and players are packed in here, with more than 300 motion-capture animations providing for extremely realistic play. They consulted over a dozen popular big leaguers in the construction of the game, yielding more than 250 signature moves and accurate player personalities. Take your pick from eight different styles of play, including Full Season, Playoffs, and a Franchise mode that casts you as the team's GM and lets you control all of the front office maneuvering. Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully provides all of the play-by-play action, and Dave Campbell tags along doing color commentary. From the first pitch to the World Series-saving catch made in deep right field to close out the season, MLB 2002 is a complete baseball package.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mlb-2002"}
