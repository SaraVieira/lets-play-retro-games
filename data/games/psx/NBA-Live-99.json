Some of the major additions in Live 99 include Practice Mode and multi-season play featuring player development between seasons. Although it did not feature free agency or generated rookies, it would turn out to be the forerunner to Franchise Mode. Live 99 shipped with 1997-98 season rosters due to the NBA lockout of 1998–99 putting a hold on player movements and rookie signings during the summer of 1998.","total_rating":78.4899336671703,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-live-99","videos":[{"id":2957,"game":811,"name":"Game intro","video_id":"opBRfzl7J2g","checksum":"17479b7a-496b-fd03-ee68-197ceaf7f976"}]}
