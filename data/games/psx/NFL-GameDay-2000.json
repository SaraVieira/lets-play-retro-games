Well in this scenario, the quarterback is not the retired John Elway, but his replacement Bubby Brister, and the game is not a live broadcast but another go at 989 Studio's NFL GameDay 2000. The 2000 edition features more balanced plays, better CPU AI (including a pre-snap AI scheme), and more than 200 new motion captured animations.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-gameday-2000"}
