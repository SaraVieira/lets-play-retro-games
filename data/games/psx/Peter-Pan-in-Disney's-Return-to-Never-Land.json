Since he now knows where the treasure is located he hacks up the treasure map to pieces and scatters the pieces throughout Neverland so no one else will be able to locate the treasure. Meanwhile, the fairy Tinkerbell informs Peter Pan that there is a treasure somewhere in Neverland. So now Peter Pan and Tinkerbell are on a quest to locate the hidden treasure too by finding and putting back together the pieces of the sliced up treasure map.\n\nPlayers take the role of Peter Pan and occasionally as Tinker Bell throughout 20 different stages. Some of the stages include Hangman's Tree, the Mermaid Lagoon, Pirate's Cove, Indian village, and Skull Rock.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/peter-pan-in-disneys-return-to-never-land"}
