To his horror, a deadly breed of intelligent apes has evolved from mankind and now dominate the Earth.

Familiar faces like Cornelius and Dr. Zaius - even new terrors like mandrill assassins and renegade baboons - await in this pulse-pounding tribute to the sc-fi cinema classic The future of the human race lies with one. It lies with you.","total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/planet-of-the-apes--1"}
