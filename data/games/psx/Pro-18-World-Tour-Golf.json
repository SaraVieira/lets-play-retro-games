Courses and players are photo-realistic, with course layouts accurate to within 3 centimetres. There are no fly-bys, although you can pan around the course to give some clues as to its layout. Four button presses are used to take a shot; draw and fade are set by how long the appropriate press is held down for. \n \nSeveral leading players are featured, including Colin Montgomerie and Vijay Singh as well as female and amateur players. There are three courses - Royal County Down, The Lost City and Couer D'Alene (plus Royal Birkdale on the North American edition).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-18-world-tour-golf"}
