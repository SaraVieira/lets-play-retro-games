You're Eric Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things about the case you couldn't otherwise. The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.","total_rating":33.5,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/psychic-detective"}
