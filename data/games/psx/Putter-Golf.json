It features both a \"normal\" 9-hole course, with realistic courses, as well as a \"trick\" 9-hole course, with somewhat more unusual features, such as warp zones and conveyor belts. Rounding out the package is a mix mode, with randomly selected holes from both courses, and a practice mode that both allows you to practice hitting on various slopes, and try out the features from the trick mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/putter-golf--1"}
