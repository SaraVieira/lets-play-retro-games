Some levels do however have several new areas and some cutscenes have been changed as well. This is the first version to have full voice acting. Many graphical changes are present, most notably in the Hall of Doors. A new bonus level can be unlocked which lets the player try a stage from the 2D prototype. Instead of Lums being imprisoned in cages, there are now Ludivs, Greenbottles and Minisaurus.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-2-the-great-escape--3"}
