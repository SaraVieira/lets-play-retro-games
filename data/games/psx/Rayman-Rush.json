In many ways, it is like half of a port of Rayman Arena, featuring conversions of the same race tracks, the same introduction movie and also character theme songs (it, however, lacks the battles from M, and the character roster is different). It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman M/Arena.\n\nRaces take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-rush"}
