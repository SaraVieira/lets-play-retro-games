The majority of the action is experienced in the Season mode, however, where you are challenged to maintain a fishing career. From the Aqua Lodge menu screen, you will be able to travel between three different rooms: your work desk, the fish tank room, and the stock corner. At your desk, you can read \"Fish Find\" magazine for more information on how to catch fish, or you can search through your lure and fly organizer (empty at the beginning of the game). \n \nIf you catch some fish and decide to keep them, you have the option of placing them in one of the appropriate fish tanks. One is for salt water, one for fresh water and one for running water. Once you start fishing in the Season mode, you're able to choose between two fishing spots. When you catch a certain number of fish, you're allowed to go to more areas and gain levels.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reel-fishing-ii"}
