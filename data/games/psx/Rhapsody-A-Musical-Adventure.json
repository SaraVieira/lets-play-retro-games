The majority of the game is about Cornet and Kururu trying to save Prince Ferdinand (whom Cornet is in love with) after he has been turned to stone by the self-proclaimed \"most beautiful witch in the world.\" The witch, Marjoly, also has a crush on the prince and had meant to put him to sleep, but messed up the spell and accidentally turned him to stone.","summary":"Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, released in Japan as The Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation from Atlus USA and Nippon Ichi Software, the creators of Disgaea, and is part of the Marl Kingdom series.\n\nRhapsody, along with its sequels, are considered musical RPGs, meaning in place of FMV cutscenes, there are musical numbers, complete with vocals. The game is also known for its \"overwhelming cuteness\" and low level of difficulty. Although this may make the game seem geared towards a younger audience, in Japan, the game and series in general has seen much success.","total_rating":62.48672453402195,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rhapsody-a-musical-adventure","videos":[{"id":44393,"game":16997,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"hIae7siP1Ds","checksum":"a0bd41d0-3a41-0dc4-4375-e9b0f18f2f5a"}]}
