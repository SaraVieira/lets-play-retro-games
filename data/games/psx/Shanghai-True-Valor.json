Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding \"free\" tiles of the same type. \n \nFor instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shanghai-true-valor"}
