As in earlier releases in the Spec Ops series, the player takes control of two operatives from a small group of highly trained Army Rangers in this next title from Runecraft and Take 2. Each member of the group has a specialty so choosing the right duo for a given mission is an important factor of success.\n\nThe action takes place in 3D-rendered environments as the player guides the characters from a third-person perspective. In the single-player version of the game, the player takes the role of one soldier while the computer guides the other.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spec-ops-ranger-elite","videos":[{"id":53276,"game":9345,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"ElbUrhX4feE","checksum":"a989bae5-75e2-489a-d065-d830e4d48ed2"}]}
