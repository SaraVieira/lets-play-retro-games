The first track is identical, except for the lack of a pit lane, the Sonic sculpture in a wall and the different sponsor banners. The major difference between the two games is the performance of the car and the fact that the player can use all the gadgets of the anime Mach 5. The gadgets can be used to \"shunt\" other cars (even with the Cutter, the cars only bounce and there is no damage in the game), take shortcuts (by cutting trees and passing under lakes), etc. The controls are simple and the player switches over the gadgets and the camera views. The player can choose the length of the race in the menu, along basic sound options.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/speed-racer--1","videos":[{"id":23018,"game":111562,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"D59PZgUt6aw","checksum":"4f829ddf-5595-6000-fe8a-aeedd5079691"}]}
