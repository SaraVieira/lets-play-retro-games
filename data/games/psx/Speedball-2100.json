Managing Brutal Deluxe, the laughing stock of the World Speedball League, you've got nothing to lose. If winning is less about sportsmanship and more about playing dirty, using power-ups, and hospitalizing your opponents, then you've got to be a brute and a casual killer to succeed.","summary":"This 32-bit update to the original Speedball is best described as a futuristic combination of hockey and rollerball. Speedball 2100 pits two teams of nine players in a cage-like arena where they attempt to score by sending a steel ball past the goalie and into the small goal box. You can bounce the ball off the walls, and you can send opponents flying to the floor with a friendly shoulder charge. Fans of the predecessor will appreciate this sequel.\n\nSpeedball 2100, released only for the PlayStation, is a 3D version of Speedball 2 with more options such as choosing and renaming any team, instead of having to play with Brutal Deluxe. This version, released in September 2000, failed to win over gamers and press because it lacked the speed and gameplay of the originals. Speedball 2100 will be released on Evercade as part of the Bitmap Brothers Collection 1.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/speedball-2100","videos":[{"id":4125,"game":10153,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"BwxiGQOo6AE","checksum":"d9e53fe3-50f0-eefc-b8d5-ac2ca1e92290"},{"id":4130,"game":10153,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"KOixphnLY4I","checksum":"08257283-6e91-ca6c-a0a5-f2571bc0f501"}]}
