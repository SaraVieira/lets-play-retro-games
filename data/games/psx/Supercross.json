Tricks are smoother and may come a little more easily, but players will still have to hold the right line and perfect their timing if they're going to be real contenders in the Motocross circuit. Players will race through several indoor and outdoor tracks in this dirt bike simulation from EA SPORTS, and a freestyle mode is available as well, offering a perfect track for maximum air and wild tricks. \n \nThe most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well. Besides, with this game's new hold-the-accelerator-and-don't-let-go approach, gamers will get a better sense of the speed they would experience in they actually participated in a motocross event. \n \nThe game is known in usa as Supercross 2001","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/supercross"}
