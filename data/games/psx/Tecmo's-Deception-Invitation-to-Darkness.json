Your brother just happens to be in the kings chambers with you at the time and calls for the guards, claiming that you killed their father. \n \nYou are promptly sentenced to death in the town square. Your dying wish is that whomever framed you be brought to justice and that your life be spared...oh, you also yell out something to the fact that you would even sell your soul to Satan if your wish could be granted...Guess what, the devil just happened to be listening to you. \n \nAfter your death, you are visited by one of his messengers, a woman named Astarte. She informs you that your life has been spared (in a way) but the catch is that you must spend the rest of your \"life\" as the master of a mansion. As part of the deal, you must lure people into the mansion and sacrifice their souls to Satan himself...","summary":"Should you enter Tecmo's Deception you should be warned! You must decide who lives and who dies. As in life, Tecmo's Deception will hold you responsible for your actions. Everything you do, everywhere you go, everyone you meet has a reason. Are you seeking revenge, resurrection, or redemption? It's your decision.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tecmos-deception-invitation-to-darkness"}
