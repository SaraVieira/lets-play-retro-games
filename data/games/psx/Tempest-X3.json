Droids that help you fight and enhanced graphics and sound; and Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and the Generator, which cranks out an endless source of enemies.","summary":"In Tempest X3 you control a claw that perches and crawls around the outer edge of a series of geometrically shaped, tube-like constructs, shooting down or out into the nebulous void of outer space. From the core of this void, fuseballs, rockets, pulsars, tankers and other hazardous aliens and alien artifacts move toward your ship. Once you clear a screen, you fly into the void and onto the next level. Watch out for spikes as you advance.","total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tempest-x3","videos":[{"id":50129,"game":71878,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"S2CNGg8-VwE","checksum":"b8baab55-020a-cc03-e3ac-e52940b36155"}]}
