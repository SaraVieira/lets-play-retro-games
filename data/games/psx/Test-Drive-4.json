Each car has its own realistic physics, with challenging handling. \n \nThere are five full circuits, plus a drag strip. You can contest a full world championship, plus single races and ghost-car time trials. The ability to find shortcuts which is featured in the third game in the series is not included here; you must stick to the pre-defined track layout.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/test-drive-4"}
