Those are the vehicles included in TEST DRIVE OFF ROAD. You can choose from four different vehicles: a Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71. In addition to the four starting vehicles six more become available with extended play and include a monster truck, dune buggy, stock car, hot rod, Mini Cooper, and an off-road beetle. When you are ready to race there is a Mixed League and Class League to choose from. Mixed League is open to any vehicle and Class League restricts the entries to vehicles of a particular type. While you are racing the 12 tracks offer three different surfaces including dirt, snow, and rocks.
