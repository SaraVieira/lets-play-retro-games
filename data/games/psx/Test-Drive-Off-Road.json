This time twenty vehicles are available to choose from, but before you can get behind the wheel, you'll have to purchase them with credits earned from winning races. \n \nSome of the licensed vehicles include a Hummer, Dodge Ram, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover, Ford F-150 and a Dodge T-Rex. The World Tour consists of five events divided by class: Hummer, Safari, SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), Truck and Military. Each class has you competing against five similar vehicles in a series of races, where you'll need to place within the top three in order to advance to the next track.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/test-drive-off-road-2","videos":[{"id":36277,"game":45086,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"xRpglDsEi-U","checksum":"26a68620-2666-796d-5a91-0550be696170"},{"id":36278,"game":45086,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"QMNUsD_FfQw","checksum":"88149be2-8c2c-4e27-a536-ea30a767b52b"}]}
