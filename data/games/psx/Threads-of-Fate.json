Mint wants to use the Dewprism for world domination, while Rue wants to use its powers to resurrect Claire.\n\nYet another person seeking the relic's power is Doll Master, who wants to resurrect his master, Valen, so he could finish his mission.","summary":"Threads of Fate is a 1999 action platform video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation console.
