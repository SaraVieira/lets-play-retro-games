Lara is still missing and presumed dead. Lara Croft is missing in Egypt - presumed dead. Those closest to her gather together at the Croft Estate on a grey, rainy day for a memorial service in her honour. Afterwards, the friends sit quietly together in the study of the Croft Mansion and reminisce about Lara's past exploits that have until now remained a secret...","summary":"Tomb Raider: Chronicles is the fifth game in the Tomb Raider series and the sequel to Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. It was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.","total_rating":64.51853900407869,"total_rating_count":74,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-chronicles","videos":[{"id":52636,"game":1160,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"GnRgA9OjjKU","checksum":"953a4943-8a15-4fad-2fd9-4825526d587b"}]}
