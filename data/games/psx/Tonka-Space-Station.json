Each challenge also features a different Tonka vehicle to help you complete your task, such as driving the TEV (the Tonkonium Extraction Vehicle) with the front mounted drill or speeding through space in a space ship. \n \nThe game not only provides arcade action but also teaches the responsibilities associated with running a space station. You start off with a small group of people, and with careful management you can watch your population grow. You can monitor their happiness levels, as well as how productive they are. Remember, these people are counting on you. \n \nSo team up with Tonka Joe and see if you have what it takes to build a successful space station. Are you the person for the job?","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tonka-space-station"}
