For the animations of the players, 3 players of the club Sheffield Wednesday served as motion capture models.\n\nActua Soccer contains only 44 national teams, each containing 22 players. However, in 1996 a new version containing clubs was released: Actua Soccer: Club Edition. It contained 20 Premier League teams from the 1996/1997 season.
