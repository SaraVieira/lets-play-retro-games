Developed by a team of physicists and professional pool players, Virtual Pool brings the game to life with the highest degree of accuracy. Balls roll, skid, collide and move on a fully rendered 3D controlled pool table that mirrors reality.\n\nVirtual Pool has revolutionary features that allow players to actually 'walk' around the table to check out their next shot, take a closer look, back away, look left or right and then line-up the shot like they would in a real game with a real table. This title also allows players to take an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game!\n\nTaking game tips from World Champion pool player \"Machine Gun\" Lou Butera is guaranteed to improve the player's game. \"Machine Gun\" Lou will teach players over 30 famous trick shots the player can practice on their computer screen and then implement on a real table.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virtual-pool"}
