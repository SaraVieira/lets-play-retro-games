The game was released for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation as a tie-in to X-Men.\n\nX-Men: Mutant Academy is a basic fighting game that uses six buttons: three buttons for punches and three for kicks. Due to the success of the game, it was followed by two sequels: X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 and X-Men: Next Dimension. The game's characters can be played both with their comic book costumes and their costumes from the 2000 film X-Men. Characters not present in the film were given costumes of a similar design.","total_rating":44.92313542870875,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-mutant-academy"}
