If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.","total_rating":61,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zoop"}
