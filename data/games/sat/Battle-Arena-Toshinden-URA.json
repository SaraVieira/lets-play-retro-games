The original Toshinden’s final boss and also Remix’s exclusive character have been removed. The gameplay could be described as a hybrid of the Playstation’s Toshinden and Toshinden 2 with movement like the former but the latter’s combo system.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack"}
