The player character must venture into the complex and find out what is really happening there, at first avoiding various traps and hazards, and later learning to set them against those who harbor evil plans.\n\nDouble Switch is a \"trap-'em-up\" game very similar to Night Trap in gameplay and visual presentation. The player has to manipulate cameras to avoid or set traps, affecting the course of the storyline which is represented by live action movie sequences.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-switch--1","videos":[{"id":56128,"game":139169,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"TF-WTVEgfV8","checksum":"bdd942a4-3041-1572-d52a-4d3062b8f3b7"}]}
