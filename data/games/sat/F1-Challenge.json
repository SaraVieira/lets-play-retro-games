The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above. \n \nThe cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.","total_rating":55.5,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-career-challenge","videos":[{"id":7274,"game":5830,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"BywaOcBoJX4","checksum":"aee0b816-96fb-8b23-2dd6-2fa0e36f9efe"}]}
