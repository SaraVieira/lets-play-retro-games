Highway 2000 delivers driving excitement with all cylinders firing! Fly through five harrowing highway courses with your choice of three high-performance racing machines - the speed and handling of the Mad Viper, the awesome acceleration of the Dark Nebula and the stick-to-the-road grip of the Rapid Fire. Slide with all four wheels into a hairpin curve. Negotiate treacherous tunnels, narrow bridges and heavy highway traffic. Challenge a fellow racer to a winner takes all split-screen barn burner! You can see the action from above, from the road or your driver's seat. It's your road! Get out onto the highway and go!\n\nThis is the Australian/European version of Wangan Dead Heat, released in Japan. This version cut all of the content relating to wooing women in the career, a large part of the Japanese release.
