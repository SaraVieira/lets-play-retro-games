You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for. \n \nThe story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/solar-eclipse"}
