{"id":94450,"first_release_date":827452800,"name":"Suiko Enbu Fuunsaiki","slug":"suiko-enbu-fuunsaiki","summary":"An enhanced port of Suiko Enbu (aka, Dark Legend) exclusively upgraded for the Saturn. \n \nThe game is a one-on-one 2D fighting set in medieval China and based around the myths of the classic \"Shuihuzhuan\" Chinese story. As usual for a beat 'em up, gameplay consists of you selecting your champion from a group of 14 fighters and clashing against each other using your specific moves and attacks. Additionally, each character fights with his own unique weapon, but depending on how much you block your weapon can break and you must finish the fight barehanded and using a different moveset and generally faster (but less powerful) attacks. \n \nThis enhanced port features three additional speed settings and refined balance between each fighter, two all new characters (plus the main boss as a selectable fighter) a brand new intro and new backgrounds. Features single-player or two-player vs gameplay.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/suiko-enbu-fuunsaiki"}
