The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.\n\nAlthough the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zaxxons-motherbase-2000"}
