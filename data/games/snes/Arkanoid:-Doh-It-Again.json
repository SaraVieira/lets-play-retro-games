The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appear. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-doh-it-again","videos":[{"id":36734,"game":42636,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"tZXt13Ay_Bc","checksum":"b2fdd3d0-317a-2925-b545-86eade00a9b7"}]}
