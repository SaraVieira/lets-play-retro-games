It is fundamentally a left-to-right scrolling fighter beat 'em up, a genre that was featured heavily on the console at the time. The gameplay and graphics are very similar to the Final Fight games. The game takes the player through seven scenes featured in the film. Each scene has a boss fight that Batman must win in order to proceed to the next scene.","total_rating":63.5304351507467,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-returns--3","videos":[{"id":29106,"game":121242,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"i380sW3DWuM","checksum":"c991f187-5661-395a-da21-de75fca67066"},{"id":40640,"game":121242,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"VsIYXPx3hLI","checksum":"d7e8734e-eb8a-3e15-af9c-56858cf76798"}]}
