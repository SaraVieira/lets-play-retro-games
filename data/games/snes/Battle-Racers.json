Besides several obstacles and speed energizers scattered by the courses, players can attack opponents by firing Blasters (a la Super Mario Kart special items) at your adversaries; the limit is 5 Blasters per race except by Cog Soldier's infinite Blaster amount.\n\nAlong with 1-Player game modes (Race, Time Trial and VS CPU), the game also offers 2-Player split-screen gameplay through Race and 2P VS plus 3 alternative modalities: Point Race, where players must to race over objects to earn points; Bumper Chase, with the main objective to ram the opponent off the course; and Blaster Master, a Life Energy-based deathmatch.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/power-rangers-zeo-battle-racers","videos":[{"id":62428,"game":3295,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"1_yJD2plGkI","checksum":"60f44162-b1e8-d637-9041-65896fae43b8"}]}
