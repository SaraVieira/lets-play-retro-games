Basketball teams play in gruelling league matches where new players are bought and sold. Within this future, basketball uses a dedicated robot to perform the toss up at the start of each match as referees had been fired by Bill Laimbeer sometime prior to the year 2030. As a result, players now wear armor to their games and weapons are thrown from the audience.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bill-laimbeers-combat-basketball","videos":[{"id":30682,"game":46002,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"kBZjf96WbGQ","checksum":"66f7def9-dedb-1187-e7c6-df11c540f535"}]}
