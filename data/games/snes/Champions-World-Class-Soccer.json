Shown from a slightly tilted 3rd-person side perspective, players can do an exhibition match, full tournament or go against a human player in the 2-player exhibition mode. The different teams are ranked by speed, offense and defence, and different team formations can be selected.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic: players can pass, shoot, tackle with a third button used to switch between players. In the options menu, fouls and offside can be disabled, the amount of time per half can be determined and there is a radar and mini-map to track the other players. The European edition is endorsed by Ryan Giggs and the game uses a password system to continue tournaments","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/champions-world-class-soccer","videos":[{"id":19456,"game":46229,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"8hDFdRavC6k","checksum":"29b543c2-23ff-f6d7-b43e-e5664abe5d8a"}]}
