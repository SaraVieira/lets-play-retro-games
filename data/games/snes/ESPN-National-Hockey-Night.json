This one featured all the NHL teams for its time, but lacked an official players license. \n \nIt had four game modes to choose from: Exhibition, Challenge, Playoff, and Season. The game also features both a horizontal and vertical perspective of the ice, battery backup to save progress and also featured the voice of Bill Clement for play-by-play commentary.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/espn-national-hockey-night"}
