Drive real cars, like the FW14B Williams, McLaren's MP4/7, the F92 Ferrari, the V8 Ford-powered Benettion B192, and other Formula One racing machines. You'll start out in a prototype Group C car and must win on all 8 tracks to move up. Next you race in F3000 cars to develop the lightning-fast reflexes needed to survive Formula One racing. Finally, you face the real 1992 Formula One season drivers and their cars. On the 16 international courses, it's a duel of nerves, skill, grit and nitro. This game blows the competition away.\n\nA new standard in racing simulation is born and F1-ROC II is it.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-roc-ii-race-of-champions"}
