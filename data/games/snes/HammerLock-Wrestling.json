How close? Jaleco's exclusive ringside perspective brings the action right under your eyelids. In addition to the main screen, you get two ringside screens. See your opponent's hand pull back for a punch so you can time your dodge perfectly. Then watch the close-up screen explode to twice its regular size as you grab his legs and throw him into a spine splintering suplex. See it all like it's just inches away - closer than you've ever seen it before.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hammerlock-wrestling"}
