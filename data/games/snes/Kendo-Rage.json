Jo is into Kendo, Japanese fencing, so her parents sent her to Japan to study under Osaki sensei. Osaki is the greatest sword master of all time, but he looks like a green haired cyberpunk. Just to crank up the strangeness Osaki gives you a talisman that transforms you into a seventies super hero. You've never seen action this crazy or fun.
