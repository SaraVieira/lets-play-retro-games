The player picks a location to fish using an overhead map where the player is then taken to a behind the person perspective to cast their reel. Once the player casts their line, the view will change to a split screen with the original view on the top with a underwater view on the bottom to view the bait and an approaching fish.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mark-davis-the-fishing-master"}
