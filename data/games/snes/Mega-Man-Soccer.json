The game is based on the original Mega Man series of action-platform games. Mega Man Soccer was first released in Japan on February 17, 1994 and in North America in April of that same year.\nMega Man Soccer is a traditional soccer game with exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues that can be played both single-player and multiplayer depending on the mode. The game features characters and Robot Masters from previous entries in the original Mega Man series. Each character has a unique special shot that will temporarily disable anyone that comes in contact with the ball. This aspect of Mega Man Soccer was met with critical praise, but overall reception has been average, particularly due to its perceived poor play control.","total_rating":48.77200603317939,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-soccer"}
