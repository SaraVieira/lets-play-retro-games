As a result the magic school is destroyed and the headmaster of the school orders Chezni to destroy Dal Gren at whatever cost before it destroys the world. During his travels he meets a girl named Midia, very much like himself, who wishes to help him on his quest, and numerous other mercenaries that come to aid Chezni. The main antagonist is a young dictator named Zaygos, who wants to use the Dal Gren for his own nefarious purposes.","summary":"Paladin's Quest is the first game in the Lennus series. It is an Fantasy JRPG for the Super Nintendo / Super Famicom. \n \nA defining feature for the game is that there is no Magic Point system. Rather health is used to cast magic. There is also no healing magic. Rather bottles can be bought at most towns with limited uses to heal the characters and various other buffs. Each character that the player can recruit has an elemental affinity, that can be combined when casting spells.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/paladins-quest","videos":[{"id":42887,"game":46586,"name":"Game Intro","video_id":"4XWQPKGRxG0","checksum":"49073537-7f4e-029a-16f6-7e31aa5a71ec"}]}
