And now the animation is more detailed, and the controls more responsive. There's even a five part training mode for sharpening your running, jumping, climbing and sword fighting skills.\nBut the sands of time are against you. For you must survive 20 perilous stages, rescure the princess from the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar, and claim the royal residency all before the hourglass is empty.\nBeware the unpredictable floors and ceilings, gut splitting guillotines, hidden spikes, walls of flames and more. Jaffar's spells spell doom if you're not crafty and nimble. And a legion of savage servants, amazing amazons and immortal skeletons will do his barbaric bidding. Even your own alter ego is the enemy.\nPass through invisible doors and walk through space portals. Find vessels of magic potions, but partake of them wisely. They may increase your life or just as easily poison you. So take each step with caution, young would-be prince, or the entire kingdom will suffer the darkest Arabian night ever.\n\nPrince of Persia was ported to many systems, but the version for the SNES was extended. Not only were the graphics improved significantly, the the amount of levels and their size was increased as well. Instead of one hour for twelve levels, the player now has two hours to beat 20 levels.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/prince-of-persia--3"}
