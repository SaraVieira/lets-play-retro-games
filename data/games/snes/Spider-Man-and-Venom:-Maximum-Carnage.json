The game, based on a sprawling comic book story arc of the same name, features numerous heroes, including Spider-Man, Venom, and their allies from the Marvel Comics fictional universe like Captain America, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger, Deathlok, Morbius and Firestar, all teaming up to battle an onslaught of villains led by Carnage, including Shriek, Doppelganger, Demogoblin and Carrion.\n\nBoth the Genesis/Mega Drive and Super NES versions come in a red cartridge. They were later released in the normal cartridge colors (black for Genesis, gray for Super NES).\n\nThe game was followed up by a sequel called Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety.\n\nUniversal Studios Orlando used Maximum Carnage as the theme for a haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights in 2002.","total_rating":66.4356493505664,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-and-venom-maximum-carnage"}
