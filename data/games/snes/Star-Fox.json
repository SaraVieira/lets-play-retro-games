An estimated 2000 cartridges were made.\n\nIn the United States, the Super Star Fox Weekend was played by tens of thousands of competitors in malls across the country. Stores such as KB Toys and Suncoast Video (usually any store that carried Super Nintendo games participated) hosted the event. After the competition, a limited number of the Super Weekend cartridges were sold through the Nintendo Power magazine, listed in the Spring 1994 \"Super Power Supplies\" catalog that was mailed to subscribers, with an original list price of $45.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the competition was known as the Star Wing Challenge and was held in gaming shops across the country on May 29, 1993.\n\nNintendo Netherlands also held the Starwing competition at various game selling stores in early 1993.
