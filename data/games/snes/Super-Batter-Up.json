The game carries the MLBPA license, but not an MLB license, so it only features all the players from the 1991 season playing for a team in a city that they really play for. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-batter-up"}
