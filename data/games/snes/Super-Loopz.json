Feature enhanced graphics and new musics, but the same gameplay: sort of Tetris encounter Pipe Dream. Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-loopz"}
