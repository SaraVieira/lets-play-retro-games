They pioneered and established hundreds of planet states, established the Galactic Federation centered on the planet Olga, and were committed to mutual security cooperation and non-aggression between states. Even after thousands of years, the power that never fades, the growing machine “Silver Hawk”, a formal fighter of the Galactic Commonwealth Army, was deployed as a standard fighter in all federal member states and was in charge of security.\n\nThe wise men of the past had ordered numerous enhancements, improvements and mass production, in preparation for the imminent return of the invaders. Everyone has long since received the legendary names of two former heroes, Proco and Tiat, as legends. Young generations who wish to fight in such an era are considered foolish.\n\nHowever, the history repeats itself. Now again, new war fronts are about to be opened in the corners of the galaxy. The huge and unknown enemy is different from the former “Belsar”. No, the former \"Belsar\" was only a small part of a larger army!","summary":"Darius Force, also known in North America as Super Nova, is a shoot 'em up game released for the Super Nintendo in 1993.\n\nOne main difference between this game and the rest of the Darius games is that the player can choose one of three Silver Hawks to play. The green one is the Silver Hawk of Darius. The blue one is the Silver Hawk of Darius II. The red one is a new prototype of Silver Hawk that exists only in this game.\n\nThere are three power-ups in this game, which can be obtained in three ways:\n- Destroying a complete formation of ships like in Darius II and Darius Twin or amoebas.\n- Destroying a flashing meteor during a meteor rain.\n- Destroying a futuristic cage on the floor and/or ceiling of an area.\n\nThe power-ups for this game are the red bubble (shot and bomb power up), the blue bubble (shield regenerate and level up), and the green bubble (randomly gives a bonus point or an extra ship). There is also a special power up that can destroy all enemies on screen if it's destroyed (like Darius II) or can make the Silver Hawk shoot a powerful laser beam if its grabbed by the player.\n\nThere is no power up bar, which means that if a Silver Hawk is destroyed, the shots and bombs are powered down to the minimum level. Also, when the player loses a ship on a stage, it is returned to the 'check point' (not identify in game) of that stage, if the ship has lost during a boss also return the last 'check point' before the boss appear.\n\nLike Darius Twin, the player uses (by default) the Y button for shot and the B button for dropping bombs. As long as the player keeps pressed both buttons, the shots are powered down one level. The player can switch between bombs and side laser guns by pressing the R button.\n\nThe stages map for this game is very different of the rest of the Darius games. This map contains 15 stages, but only allows the player to take the forward or up paths, until the player reaches the L, N or O stage. Each one of those three stages contains its own boss and ending.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-nova","videos":[{"id":48049,"game":42446,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"w45HrUxS6u8","checksum":"b0718cc3-fc32-dbd1-73cd-acd9ed7dffad"}]}
