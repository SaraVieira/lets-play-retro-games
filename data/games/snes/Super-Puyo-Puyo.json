The Puyos are little creatures with eyes who, in most variations of the game, fall from the top of the screen in a pair. The pair can be moved left and right and rotated. The pair falls until it reaches another puyo or the bottom of the screen.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-puyo-puyo","videos":[{"id":41904,"game":42406,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"McqcIRsjsWc","checksum":"51b2f15c-61a6-4b35-059f-260c630ae205"}]}
