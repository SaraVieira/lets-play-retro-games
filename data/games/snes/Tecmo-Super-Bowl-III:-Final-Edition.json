This game features real NFLP players and photos, the real NFL schedule, and weekly standings. You can change defensive and offensive formations, create your own Pro Bowl, fake punts and field goals, go for the two point conversion, and call audibles. Updates to the game itself include new cinema screens, superstar mode, free agency system, improved graphics, larger field simulation, passing modes, and improved speech and music.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tecmo-super-bowl-iii-final-edition"}
