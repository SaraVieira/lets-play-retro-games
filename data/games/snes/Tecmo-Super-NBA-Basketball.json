One or two players can compete in regular, reduced, or short seasons, or play an exhibition game. Though primarily horizontal scrolling, digitized speech and cinemas, along with a free throw point of view, add drama to the proceedings. Besides the expected elements of basketball (substitutions, penalties, steals and blocks, time-outs, overtime), Super NBA gives you the chance to call offensive plays and to program win/loss records. Has a battery to back-up season play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tecmo-super-nba-basketball"}
