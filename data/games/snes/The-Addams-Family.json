Addams Family's lawyer, Tully Alford, has taken control of their Gothic mansion and imprisoned Morticia Addams, Pugsley Addams, Wednesday Addams, Granny and Uncle Fester. The player controls Gomez Addams as he explores the various rooms in the mansion, locating items and battling monsters, until he has located all of the lost family members. The game has an almost completely open-world format, unusual for games of this era, which gives players the freedom to choose what order they will save the family members in. However, Gomez cannot save Morticia until the rest of the family is rescued.","summary":"Creepy, Kooky, Ooky, Spooky!
