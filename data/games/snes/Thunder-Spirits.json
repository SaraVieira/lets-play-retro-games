Thunder Spirits puts you behind the cockpit of a lone starfighter out to destroy all the enemy forces of the Orn empire by clearing 8 enemy-infested stages set in various outer space locations.\n\nThe game gives you a health-bar and the ability to swap collected weapons on the fly, which can be obtained by catching power-ups and activating them whenever you want.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/thunder-spirits"}
