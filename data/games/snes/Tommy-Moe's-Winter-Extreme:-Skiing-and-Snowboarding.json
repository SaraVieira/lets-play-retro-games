The Slalom has the same set-up where the player has to finish the course in an allotted time by passing through gates, but also has to contend with twists, turns and various other obstacles in the players path. The Giant Slalom is similar except for more obstacles and a longer path.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tommy-moes-winter-extreme-skiing-and-snowboarding"}
