The objective of the game is to become the fastest driver in the world by racing other drivers across several nations. The franchise is unrelated to the TV series of the same name. The game is an arcade-style racing game that can be played by two players at the same time.\"\n\n\"When players first start the game, they are given several options to choose from, including entering their name, a choice of four different controller layouts, a choice between automatic or manual transmission, and their choice of four unique cars. During the race, the player will have to steer and shift gears (if they chose a manual transmission). The player is also given control over three \"nitros\", which allow the player to increase their speed for a short period of time.\" - wikia","summary":"\"Top Gear sends players over eight countries around the world with one of four cars, facing sharp turns, pit stops, and debris in this arcade-style racing game.\"","total_rating":85.53871431688201,"total_rating_count":25,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/top-gear"}
