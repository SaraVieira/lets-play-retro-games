Gameplay is standard beat 'em up style action, featuring most of the conventions of the genre. The characters have a range of kicks, punches and throws, and each fight at their own base. The 90-second time limit can be turned on or off. Fights are best-of-three, with points awarded for each hit, and for overall victory.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tuff-e-nuff"}
