Each virtual reality program represents a stage in the game that Bart must play through in order to escape the machine before the programs crash.\n\nThe game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance via a wheel-of-misfortune.","total_rating":59.87161135318721,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virtual-bart"}
