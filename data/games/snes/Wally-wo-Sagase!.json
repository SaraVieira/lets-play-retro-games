(Where's Waldo? in the US) media franchise. You use a trackball to find Wally in a number of different ways (catching him in an animation, finding him in a door, finding him with only a small portion of the screen visible at a time, etc.). It is only known to have been released in Japan, however most people use the translated name Where's Wally!; whether or not there was an overseas release is unknown (TODO find proof).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wally-wo-sagase"}
