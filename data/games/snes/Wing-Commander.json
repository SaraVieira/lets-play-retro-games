The player gets to name the pilot and choose his call sign. The pilot (known in-production to Origin personnel as \"Bluehair\", after his most notable feature) quickly rises through the ranks of the flight wing and (presuming the player performs ideally in the cockpit) eventually leads a strike on the Kilrathi High Command starbase in the Venice system. On the other hand, if the player does not perform optimally, missions become increasingly defensive in nature, and eventually the Claw is forced to retreat.","summary":"Gameplay consists of completing successive missions and overall cockpit performance affects gameplay: going above and beyond the call of duty results in medals, promotions in rank are awarded at regular intervals, and success or failure on certain critical missions decides the player's plot progress, \"winning\" or \"losing\".","total_rating":81.4116395361981,"total_rating_count":29,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wing-commander","videos":[{"id":30300,"game":924,"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"TlokYOPAa0o","checksum":"348597a3-7d6f-4ace-9b47-6d634a6b9fcb"}]}
