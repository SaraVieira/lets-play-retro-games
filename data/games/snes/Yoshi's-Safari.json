The Koopalings have seized the Kingdom's precious jewels. It's up to Mario, armed with his trusty Super Scope, to ride Yoshi to track down Bowser and put a stop to his evil plans.","summary":"Yoshi's Safari is the first and so far the only dedicated rail shooting game in the Mario franchise, and one of the few games to use the SNES's Super Scope light gun peripheral. Gameplay consists of shooting enemies before they attack. There are bosses along the way that must be destroyed before players can move on to the next area.","total_rating":69.9093997734994,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yoshis-safari","videos":[{"id":35436,"game":11604,"name":"Gameplay Video","video_id":"UEjWHy02ORc","checksum":"7a26f470-06a8-db53-0cae-7f5782859cfa"}]}
